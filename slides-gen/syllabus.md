### 🔑 Key Content and Approach

#### 1. Overarching Goal and Theme
[cite_start]The primary goal of the textbook is to be both **rigorous and relevant** for students[cite: 163]. [cite_start]It aims to keep pace with the real-world applications of information systems, providing the necessary foundation for understanding their breadth, depth, and complexity[cite: 163].

[cite_start]A central theme is the concept of **"digital density"**[cite: 163]. [cite_start]The text posits that the exponential increase in "the amount of connected data per unit of activity" is the main driver of innovation, new business models, and hypercompetition in the modern world[cite: 163, 337]. [cite_start]The book focuses on what business students must know to "survive and thrive in the digital world"[cite: 164].

#### 2. Target Audience
[cite_start]The textbook is primarily intended for **undergraduate introductory information systems courses** required of all business students, including majors in accounting, finance, marketing, and general management[cite: 165]. [cite_start]It is also written to be valuable for students in the broader information sciences and for introductory graduate-level (e.g., MBA) courses[cite: 165, 166].

#### 3. Fundamental Structure
[cite_start]The book is structured to answer three fundamental questions[cite: 234]:
1.  [cite_start]**What** are contemporary information systems, and how are they being used in innovative ways? [cite: 235]
2.  [cite_start]**Why** are information systems so important and interesting? [cite: 235]
3.  [cite_start]**How** best can we build, acquire, manage, and safeguard information systems? [cite: 235]

### **Design Rationale**

* **10 lectures** → ensure full coverage of core chapters (1–10).
* **5 active sessions** → self-study, quizzes, teamwork align with Pearson MyLab features and case-based learning.
* **Technology Briefing** topics (hardware, software, networking) can be embedded within Sessions 3 and 11 to reinforce technical foundations without adding extra weeks.
* **Integration with Tools:** MS Excel for analytics (Ch. 6), MS Access for database apps (Ch. 9 lab).
