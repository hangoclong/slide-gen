## Enabling Business-toConsumer Electronic Commerce

## Preview

This chapter focuses on electronic commerce (e-commerce, or EC), explaining how companies conduct  business  with  customers  over  the  internet.  The increase in digital density has introduced  unprecedented  opportunities  for  the  marketing  of  products and  services,  accompanied  by  features,  functionality,  and  innovative  methods  to  serve  and  support consumers.  At  the  same  time,  conducting  business transactions  online  has  introduced  various  challenges.  With  e-commerce  representing  a  growing  proportion  of  overall  retail  sales,  an  understanding  of e-commerce  can  be  a  powerful  tool  in  your  arsenal. People with e-commerce skills are in high demand in the marketplace; therefore, the more you know about e-commerce, the more valuable you will become.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Taobao and the World of E-Commerce

M ost people in this world have heard of eBay and  Amazon,  two  U.S.-based  online  retail sites  where  one  can  typically  find  any  desired product. The online shopping fever has spread to China in the form of companies like Taobao and JD.com. Taobao,  owned  by  Alibaba,  was  founded  in  2003  and in  early  2020  had  more  than  500  million  registered users-1.5 times the population of the United States. If you have tried any of Taobao's services, you know that it has various branches. There's Taobao Marketplace, China's eBay,  which  dominates  the  country's  online  consumerto-consumer  (C2C)  e-commerce  business.  Then  there's Tmall.com, a separate site where renowned brands sell directly  to  consumers  in  a  business-to-consumer  (B2C) manner. In fact, Taobao has fostered such a holistic shopping experience that international names like Gap, Adidas,  and  Levi's,  just  to  name  a  few,  decided  to  launch their own official online retail storefronts in the virtual mall.  By  2019,  Taobao,  Tmall.com,  and  Juhuasuan  (another Alibaba site for 'flash sales') had more than 650 million active buyers, more than twice that of their competitor JD.com.

However, shoppers should beware. Taobao might be the talk of the town, but it is also known as a notorious market for piracy  and  counterfeit  goods,  with  some  of Alibaba Group's marketplaces being blacklisted by other governments. You may want to try out JD.com instead

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Describe different approaches to competing in cyberspace as well as different forms of electronic government and fintech.
2.  Describe business-to-consumer electronic commerce strategies.
3.  Understand the keys to successful electronic commerce websites and explain the different forms of internet marketing.
4.  Describe mobile commerce, voice commerce, consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce, and consumer-to-business electronic commerce.
5.  Describe how to conduct financial transactions and navigate the legal issues of electronic commerce.

(short  for  Jingdong  Mall,  formerly  360Buy), which has not made it to the list of notorious markets. The company is expanding fast, with  an  ambitious  plan  of  solving  logistics and  delivery  troubles  that  are  a  hallmark of  the  Chinese  market,  given  the  country's size  and  differences  in  population  density (Figure 4.1). Unlike their competitors, JD.com invests heavily in their own logistics solutions (instead  of  using  third-party  partners)  and hopes  to  leverage  big  data  to  reduce  costs and increase efficiency in managing and delivering inventory. The greatest barrier to online shopping in China remains trust; within China,  people  fear  being  defrauded  or  receiving substandard products. Outside China, potential customers often face language barriers when attempting to communicate with the suppliers. While low-priced offers directly from Chinese suppliers may seem tempting, these  factors  can  easily  convince  overseas

## E-Commerce and E-Government

The internet provides a set of interconnected networks for individuals and businesses to complete transactions electronically. Electronic commerce (EC) refers to the exchange of goods, services, and money 1 among firms, between firms and their customers, and between customers, supported by communication technologies and, in particular, the internet. The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce reported that, in the first quarter of 2020, online retail sales were up by nearly 15 percent compared to the first quarter of 2019, and that EC accounted for 11.8 percent of total retail sales, resulting in sales of more than US$160.3 billion in one quarter alone (Figure 4.2). Research firm Statista forecasts steady growth, anticipating global businessto-consumer e-commerce sales to exceed US$6.5 trillion by 2023. With this much money at stake, it is little wonder that no other information systems (IS) issue has captured as much attention as has EC. Already during the Berlin airlift in 1948, the foundations for EC transactions between businesses were laid, as the Military Air Transport Service of the U.S. Air Force in Europe realized that the airlifted cargo was important but that information about the cargo-such as what exactly was contained in a shipment, where it was located, or when it was scheduled to arrive-was equally important and devised standard universal codes for transmitting these data via teletype (Seideman, 1996). The emergence of the internet and web further facilitated EC and, in addition, paved the way for marketing and selling products and services to individual consumers. This has led to the creation of an electronic marketplace where a virtually limitless array of services, features, and functionality can be offered. As a result, a presence on the web has become a strategic necessity for most companies.

## Types of Electronic Commerce

Contrary  to  popular  belief,  EC  goes  beyond  consumers  merely  buying  and  selling  products online. EC can involve the events leading up to the purchase of a product as well as customer service after  the  sale.  Furthermore,  EC  is  not  limited  to  transactions  between  businesses  and consumers, which is known as business-to-consumer (B2C) EC. EC is also used by organizations to conduct business with business partners such as suppliers and intermediaries. This form

1 EC can also include the distribution of digital products, such as software, e-books, music, movies, and digital images.

TABLE 4.1 Types of EC

| Type of EC                  | Description                                                  | Example                                                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business-to-consumer (B2C)  | Transactions between businesses and their customers          | A person buys a book from Amazon.                                   |
| Business-to-business (B2B)  | Transactions among businesses                                | A manufacturer conducts business over the web with its suppliers.   |
| Consumer-to-business (C2B)  | Transactions between customers and businesses                | A person offers his or her photogra- phy at shutterstock.com.       |
| Consumer-to- consumer (C2C) | Transactions between people not necessarily working together | A person purchases some memora- bilia from another person via eBay. |

of EC, not involving the end consumer, is commonly referred to as business-to-business (B2B) EC. As many firms concentrate solely on B2B transactions, B2B EC is by far the largest form of EC in terms of revenues, with U.S manufacturers reporting e-commerce shipments totaling more than US$4 trillion in 2018 and wholesalers reporting e-commerce sales of US$2.6 trillion. Further, almost all companies focusing on the B2C arena, such as the clothing and home furnishing retailer Eddie Bauer, also engage in B2B EC. In the process of producing goods and services, a business typically sources its raw materials from a variety of specialized suppliers (in B2B transactions); after the production, the business sells each finished product to a distributor or wholesaler (in a B2B transaction) or directly to the end consumer (in a B2C transaction). We will discuss B2B EC in Chapter 8, 'Strengthening Business-to-Business Relationships via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management.'

Some forms of EC do not even involve business firms, as would be the case with transactions between consumers on an online auction site such as eBay; these forms of EC are referred to as consumer-to-consumer (C2C) EC (note that a business, eBay, provides a platform to enable transactions between consumers). A related EC model is consumer-to-business (C2B) EC, where consumers offer products, labor, and services to companies, a complete reversal of the traditional B2C model. These basic types of EC are summarized in Table 4.1.

The ever-increasing digital density has influenced various aspects of the digital world, and e-commerce is no exception. Fueled by the rise of social media, organizations are trying to leverage social networks to build lasting customer relationships, advertise products, or otherwise create value-a trend referred to as social commerce . Digital products and services are provided through the cloud (think iTunes, Dropbox, or Gmail). The Internet of Things enables companies to offer various innovative products and services that go beyond the initial purchase (such as the Nest thermostat that not only can be controlled from one's smartphone but also learns the user's schedules and habits, optimizing home energy use). With the ubiquitous use of mobile devices, mobile commerce (m-commerce) -that is, any electronic transaction or information interaction conducted using a wireless, mobile device and mobile networks (wireless or switched public network) that leads to the transfer of real or perceived value in exchange for information, services, or goods (MobileInfo, 2016)-has become a natural way of shopping online for many. Forrester Research estimates that, in the major European economies, m-commerce will double between 2018 and 2023, reaching €330 billion. Likewise, Forrester expects the share of m-commerce in U.S. B2C e-commerce (retail and travel) to reach 45 percent in 2024. In addition, B2B transactions are increasingly taking place on mobile platforms. Together, these megatrends generate a wealth of data, allowing companies to obtain an in-depth understanding of each individual customer to deliver individualized value propositions and build long-lasting customer relationships. Next, we examine the use of information systems for interactions with and between governments.

## E-Government

E-government is  the  use of information systems to provide citizens, organizations, and other governmental agencies with information about public services and to allow for interaction with the government. Similar to the EC business models, e-government involves three distinct relationships (Figure 4.3).

## FIGURE 4.3

E-government initiatives include interaction with citizens, corporations, and other governments.

<!-- image -->

GOVERNMENT-TO-CITIZENS. Government-to-citizen (G2C) EC allows for interactions between federal, state, and local governments and their constituents. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service's internet tax filing, or e-filing , is one of the more recognizable G2C services, saving resources in terms of time and paper. Other services provided by governments include the online application for ID cards, municipal services, e-voting, or the provision of electronic access to public government data.

GOVERNMENT-TO-BUSINESS. Government-to-business (G2B) is like G2C, but this form of EC involves businesses' relationships with all levels of government. This includes e-procurement, or a government's streamlining its supply chain by purchasing materials directly from suppliers using proprietary internet-enabled procurement systems. Also included in G2B initiatives are forward auctions that allow businesses to buy seized goods and surplus government equipment (these transactions can take place on a G2C level as well). Other G2B services include online applications for export licenses, verification of employees' Social Security numbers, and online tax filing.

GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT. Finally, government-to-government (G2G) EC is used for electronic interactions that take place between countries or between different levels of government within a country. Since 2002, the U.S. government has provided comprehensive e-government tools that allow foreign entities to find government-wide information related to foreign trade or business topics. Other G2G transactions relate to the intergovernmental collaboration at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels.

## Managing Financial Transactions on the Web

As we move further into the digital age, various products, services, and industries are being disrupted (see Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems'), and the financial industry is no exception. Ubiquitous accessibility, the proliferation of mobile devices, advances in cloud computing, and Big Data analytics have brought about many radical changes for the financial services industry, and many foresee further radical changes in the near future. For example, financial companies can now operate on a global scale, and many services traditionally offered by banks can now be offered by other, nontraditional players. Likewise, disintermediation has enabled firms to provide many financial services directly to the end customers, and the internet has enabled customers to easily compare prices for financial services. These changes have affected not only traditional banks but also brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other players in the financial market.

E-BANKING AND ONLINE BROKERAGE. One type of service frequently offered online is managing financial transactions. Whereas traditionally consumers had to visit their bank to conduct financial transactions, they can now manage credit card, checking, or savings accounts online using online banking or pay their bills using electronic bill pay services. Likewise, many banks created mobile banking apps for checking account balances or initiating transactions. Large banks like Chase, Citibank, USAA, Capital One, and Charles Schwab offer mobile check deposit apps, allowing customers to deposit a check by simply taking a picture of the check with a smartphone's camera. Increasing digital density has also had a large impact on payment services as well as the development of cryptocurrencies ; we will discuss these later in the chapter.

In addition to online banking, online brokerage has seen steady growth over the past several years. For example, many people turn to sites such as MSN Money, Yahoo! Finance, or CNN Money to get the latest information about stock prices, firm performance, or mortgage rates, and use online brokerage firms such as Interactive Brokers to buy or sell stocks. Further, most large online brokerage services offer trading apps for various smartphone platforms. In addition, many stock markets and foreign exchange markets around the world now use electronic trading, such that traders from around the world can trade without having to be at the market's physical location. Further, electronic trading greatly increases trading speed and reduces transaction costs.

FINTECH. Fintech (financial technology) refers to technologies that support activities in the financial sector. Often, fintech is associated with companies (often startups) that use technologies in innovative ways to disrupt activities in the financial sector; many fintech startups focus on specific types of interactions, segments, or business processes. Whereas traditional banks provide a wide range of services, fintech companies typically focus on one service, and do this very well. For example, successful fintech startups range from crowdfunding platforms such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter to online-only banks such as N26, mobile payment processors such as Square, peer-to-peer lenders such as Prosper and Lending Club, small-business lenders such as Behalf, or digital investment managers such as FutureAdvisor. Another fintech innovation is the use of artificial intelligence for providing investment advice or managing financial portfolios. However, many of the innovative services provided by fintech startups are not captured by traditional financial regulations. Therefore, many innovations in the fintech sector will necessitate changes in regulation of financial services and public policy, often on a global scale; likewise, for organizations and individuals alike, managing risks becomes paramount, especially when dealing with players who are not established in the market. On the other hand, incumbent banks now must decide how to compete or collaborate with these fintech companies. Increasingly, rather than competing with such services, traditional banks such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, or Wells Fargo collaborate with fintech startups such as the payments network Zelle to enhance their portfolio of services, and provide APIs for customers and other companies to exchange data and provide other value-added services.

## Business-to-Consumer E-Commerce

Technological forces are driving business, lowering barriers to entry and leveling the playing field, allowing small and large businesses from around the globe to sell products to a global customer base. For small companies, this opens up vast opportunities. Unlike in international sports tournaments such as the Ironman World Championship, where athletes first have to compete locally to qualify for the big event, online businesses can 'participate in the world championships' (i.e., compete on a global scale) right from the start. Companies are exploiting the capabilities of the web to reach a wider customer base, offer a broader range of products, and develop closer relationships with customers by striving to meet their unique needs.

While it is beneficial for many small companies to access a global marketplace, this also means that every company participating in a market faces increased competition, and companies must strategically position themselves. Before the internet, retailers (except for catalog merchants) operated solely using traditional physical stores; today, this approach is referred to as brick-and-mortar business strategy . Companies following this strategy solely operate physical locations such as retail stores and do not offer their products or services online. The advent of the web has enabled companies to move beyond their physical location and engage in the online

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## The AI Hedge Fund

For many years, hedge funds and money managers have relied on statistical models to improve their trading strategies. Trained in a variety of mathematical disciplines, specialists called 'quants' use historical data and other sources of information to develop sophisticated models. However, these models tend to be highly complex and can be challenging to update and adapt to changing market conditions. To speed up the process of developing and refining these models, several startup hedge funds are turning to techniques from artificial intelligence (Ai).

The field of Ai is vast and varied. many different a  pproaches have been developed in attempts to emulate the intelligence and capabilities of humans   (see   Chapter   6  , 'Enhancing business intelligence using big Data, Analytics, and Artificial intelligence')  , with some being very successful and others less so. Recent innovations in the sub-discipline of machine learning have led to widespread practical application; in particular, improvements in genetic algorithms (where many approaches are tried out and only the best survive) and deep learning (where multiple layers of neural networks are trained simultaneously) have enabled applications such as improved image and voice recognition and processing-siri, Cortana, and Alexa are but a few examples.

to the better outcomes, called 'parameters,' can then be fed back into the models for another iteration of improvement. While the resulting models can be extremely complex, the question is how to design the models such that the parameters and outcomes are useful for making trading decisions. Critics doubt that, in the long run, the new machine learning based funds will be any better at this than existing players, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. it seems that the performance of the machines is finally surpassing traditional hedge funds, mainly due to massive computing power and the machines' capacity to rapidly adjust to market conditions. However, believers in Ai-based trading foresee other issues. As Ai-based trading is expected to level the playing field, in the long run, everyone is likely to have access to the same intelligence. Yet if everyone is having access to the same intelligence, how could anyone outperform the market?

based on:

Typically, machine learning algorithms bring together data from many sources and use historical outcome information to train and improve their models. Whereas humans can operate in a similar way, the difference is that the machines can consider hundreds of thousands, even millions, of possibilities, evaluate them automatically, and then choose the ones that generate the best outcomes.

In the most extreme form of e-tailing, companies follow a click-only business strategy and only conduct business electronically in cyberspace. These firms (sometimes called virtual companies ) have no physical store locations, allowing them to focus purely on EC. An example of a click-only company is the online retailer Amazon, which does not have a physical storefront in the classic sense. In e-business terminology, clickonly companies are sometimes called 'pure play companies,' focusing on one very distinct way of doing business; other firms, such as the bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble, choose to utilize the internet to extend their traditional offline retail channels. These firms employ a click-andmortar business strategy approach (also referred to as a bricks-and-clicks business strategy ). The three general approaches are depicted in   Figure   4.  4  .

THE CLICK-AND-MORTAR STRATEGY. The greatest impact of the web-based EC revolution has occurred in companies adopting the click-and-mortar approach. Click-and-mortars continue to operate their physical locations and have added an EC component to their business activities. With transactions occurring in both physical and virtual environments, it is imperative that click-and-mortars learn how to exploit commercial opportunities in both domains. Conducting physical and virtual operations presents special challenges for these firms, as business activities must be tailored to each of these different environments in order for the firms to compete effectively (e.g., differential pricing or shipping and inventory management can suddenly become huge concerns for companies selling physical products). Traditionally, a company would

<!-- image -->

only offer its customers a single channel, be it the physical retail store, a catalog, or an online store. As companies grew, many started using a multichannel approach, offering the customer different (independent) touchpoints, such as a retail store and a catalog (a concept referred to as multichannel retailing ). Increasingly-and especially due to the proliferation of mobile devices-transactions take place across multiple environments, a concept referred to as crosschannel retailing . For example, in-store pickup refers to situations where a customer orders a product online and picks it up in a retail store; similarly, customers may evaluate products offline and purchase the products through the retailer's website. Finally, omni-channel retailing entails providing seamless, simultaneous interactions using different channels, such that a customer does not interact with a single channel but with the brand as a whole (see Figure 4.5). For example, a shopper in a retail store of electronics retailer Best Buy can scan a QR code to receive more information or product reviews, which are located on Best Buy's mobile site. Likewise, sales beacons -Bluetooth devices that can detect proximate smartphones and send messages-have become a widely used way to send marketing messages or personalized coupons to the mobile phones of in-store shoppers.

No matter which approach click-and-mortars pursue, they face various challenges due to increasing IS complexity. Design and development of complex computing systems are required to support each aspect of the click-and-mortar approach, especially when attempting to offer seamless experiences across channels.

THE CLICK-ONLY STRATEGY. Click-only companies can often compete more effectively on price because they do not need to support the physical aspects of the click-and-mortar approach. Thus, these companies can reduce prices to rock-bottom levels (although a relatively small click-only firm may not sell enough products and/or may not order enough from suppliers to be

able to realize economies of scale and thus reduce prices). Click-only firms, such as Amazon, also tend to be highly adept with technology and can innovate very rapidly as new technologies become available. This can enable them to stay one step ahead of their competition. However, conducting business in cyberspace has some problematic aspects. For example, it is more difficult for a customer to return a product to a purely online company than simply to return it to a local department store. In addition, some consumers may not be comfortable making purchases online. Individuals may be leery about the security of giving credit card numbers to a virtual company. We will discuss these potential drawbacks later in this chapter.

## E-tailing: Capabilities and Opportunities

Powerful web technologies have given rise to a global platform where firms from across the world can effectively compete for customers and gain access to new markets. Global customers do not have to rely on potentially outdated information from printed catalogs or account statements that arrive in the mail once a month but can access websites that are linked to corporate databases to provide real-time access to personalized information. Likewise, companies in the travel industry, such as airlines, can dynamically adjust fares based on availability, booking time, current and historical demand, forecast demand, and other factors to maximize revenues (a practice  referred  to  as  yield  management)  and  disseminate the most current fares in real time on the company's website. Further, the web has opened new avenues for communication between companies and their customers; firms have augmented telephone-based ordering and customer support with web-based support, artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, electronic mail, video chat applications, and social media. In many cases, these are provided to allow customers to communicate with a customer service representative in real time through the corporate website. The web not only has facilitated the dissemination of information and facilitated communication with customers but often is used to facilitate all stages of a transaction, allowing companies to conduct business online without human assistance, greatly reducing transaction costs while enhancing operational efficiency. For example, once a customer places an order, the customer's address and payment information are stored in the company's customer database, the customer's credit card is automatically charged, the inventory is checked, and the order is routed to the fulfillment center, where the shipping label is automatically generated. Aside from picking and packing the actual product, most of the transaction requires little to no human interaction. For the business, this tremendously reduces the costs associated with the transactions by reducing the demand for phone representatives taking the order or back-office staff handling the orders. In addition, the internet has enabled various new approaches to doing business. These are discussed next.

DISINTERMEDIATION. The web has disrupted many traditional business models by offering the ability to sell products directly to the end customers without the need for distributors or retailers. This phenomenon of cutting out the 'middleman' and reaching customers more directly and efficiently is known as disintermediation . Disintermediation creates both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, producers or service providers can offer products at lower prices (or reap greater profits) by bypassing traditional distribution and retail channels; on the other hand, they also have to take on those activities previously performed by these middlemen. For example, when airlines started selling tickets online and dealing directly with customers, they disintermediated travel agents. As a result, the airlines directly had to deal with upset travelers in case of delays or cancellations, while the travel agents had to find ways to make up for lost revenue, such as by charging booking fees when arranging a person's travel. In contrast, reintermediation refers to the design of business models that reintroduce middlemen to reduce the chaos brought on by disintermediation. For example, without middlemen like Travelocity. com, Orbitz.com, and other travel websites, a consumer would have to check all airline websites to find the flight with the best connection or lowest price.

THE LONG TAIL. Another opportunity enabled by the web is the ability to focus on the 'long tails.' Coined by Chris Anderson (2004, 2006), the concept of the long tail refers to catering to niche markets in addition to (or instead of) purely selling mainstream products. The distribution of consumers' needs and wants can be compared to a statistical normal distribution: The center of the distribution reflects the 'mass market,' characterized by relatively similar 'mainstream' needs and wants shared by many people; the tails are the niche markets, catering to very diverse needs and wants (but comparatively few people share the same needs and wants) (Figure 4.6). Because of high storage and distribution costs, most traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and

<!-- image -->

service providers are forced to limit their product offerings to serving the needs and wants of the mainstream customers in the center of the distribution. For example, large mainstream movie productions typically draw a huge audience and are shown in many movie theaters; in contrast, most independent movie productions are not shown at local cinemas, as they are unlikely to draw a large enough audience to cover the movie theater's costs to show the movie. Similarly, record stores carry only CDs of which a certain number of copies is likely to be sold each year to cover the costs for shelf space, sales personnel, and so on. Given the limited local reach of brickand-mortar stores, this ultimately limits the stores' product selection.

In contrast, enabled by their extended reach, many e-tailers can focus on the long tails, that is, on products outside the mainstream tastes. For instance, whereas a local video rental store is unlikely to have a large selection of documentaries (because of a lack of local demand), Netflix can afford to have a very large selection of rather unpopular movies and still make a profit with it. Rather than renting a few 'blockbusters' to many people, many (often outside the mainstream) titles are rented to a large number of people spread out on the long tails. Similarly, online bookseller Amazon can carry a tremendous selection of (often obscure) titles, as the costs for storage are far lower than those of its offline competitors. In fact, more than half of Amazon's book sales are titles that are not carried by the average physical bookstore, not even by megastores such as Barnes &amp; Noble. Likewise, fintech startups can focus on the large number of clients not deemed profitable enough by traditional banks. In other words, focusing on those titles that are on the long tails of the distribution of consumers' wants can be a very successful strategy in the digital world, and information systems can help achieve the low marginal costs and high volume needed for successfully competing in the long tails.

MASS CUSTOMIZATION. Mass consumption, one of the hallmarks of modern economic activity, is based on the concept of mass production, which reduces costs by producing large numbers of identical goods. The Ford Model T is one of the earliest successful examples of mass production; all customers were offered the same model, which was produced on an assembly line (instead of being handcrafted, as other automobiles at that time); subsequently, mass production was adopted as the standard way of producing goods to be sold at affordable prices. Web technologies, combined with the ability to interact directly with the end customers, have allowed firms to focus on the long tails by tailoring their products and services specifically to each customer's particular needs on a large scale, a model referred to as mass customization . Linking online product configuration systems with just-in-time production allows companies to assemble each individual product based on a customer's specifications so that companies are able to provide individualized products while at the same time reaping the economies of scale provided by mass production. For instance, Dell Computer Corporation allows customers to customize their computers based on their specific performance needs. Likewise, customers can design personalized tennis shoes at Nike.com, customize their Mini at miniusa.com, or even have their personalized cookies baked at kekswerkstatt.de. While manufacturing a customized product tends to be more expensive than traditional mass production, the product's value for

the customer increases, allowing the producer to charge a higher price, leading to higher profit margins (Figure 4.7). With increasing digital density, organizations can collect more data about their customers, enabling them to better predict customers' needs, facilitating mass customization even more.

GROUP BUYING. Another innovative business model enabled by the internet is group buying . Companies such as Groupon or LivingSocial negotiate special volume discounts with local businesses and offer them to their members in the form of 'daily deals'; if enough people agree to purchase the product or service, the customers typically get significant discounts over the original purchase price. The business offering the product or service uses these deals to either reduce unsold inventory or to get new customers 'into the door'; yet local businesses face the danger of making significant losses on these deals, as the group purchasing site typically takes a hefty share of the deal's price (often about 50 percent), or they may not be able to cope with the sudden increase in demand.

NEW REVENUE AND PRICING MODELS. As discussed in Chapter 2, the internet has enabled or facilitated various revenue models, with companies earning revenues not only through traditional sales but also through subscription, licensing, or transaction fees. Further, organizations and individuals alike can generate revenues through web advertisement or affiliate marketing programs. Some companies selling products or services have come up with pricing models that transcend traditional menu-driven pricing models . Under a menu-driven pricing model, companies such as Amazon or Travelocity.com set the prices that consumers pay for products or services. In contrast, Priceline.com uses a dynamic pricing model to offer consumers discounts on airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, and various other products and services. Priceline became most famous for its 'Name Your Own Price' model; customers would specify the product they were looking for and how much they were willing to pay for it, and Priceline.com matched the customers' bids with offers from companies (who often used Priceline.com to get rid of excess inventory). After a user searched for a service and submitted a bid on Priceline.com, the system routed the information to appropriate brandname companies, such as United Airlines and Avis Rent a Car, which would either accept or reject the customer's offer (Figure 4.8).

SOCIAL COMMERCE. Companies operating in the digital world have realized that people's purchasing decisions are increasingly influenced by social media. Using various social media, people explore products or engage with others about their purchasing experiences. Thus, organizations are trying to leverage social networks to advertise products, build lasting relationships, or otherwise create value. Social commerce is the use of social media to influence shopping behavior, from the pre-purchase evaluation stage to post-purchase experiences. One use of social media is to incorporate social functionality into a company's website, allowing customers to engage with the company or others through reviews or comments. For example,

<!-- image -->

Amazon presents recommendations based on what other shoppers with similar tastes have viewed or purchased and encourages shoppers to share their recent purchases on social networking sites. Likewise, online retailers incorporate social sharing functionality into their websites so that customers can share their purchases with their social networks, effectively promoting the products they purchased. Another use of social media is to use social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to advertise or sell products, distribute content, or otherwise engage with current or prospective customers. Adding social elements to the online shopping experiences not only helps increase sales but also gives the organizations a wealth of data about their customers, their motivations, and their experiences (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of social media and managing customer relationships).

In addition, several business models are built around social interactions in the online world. Consumer-to-consumer marketplaces such as eBay or Etsy allow individuals to sell products to other individuals. Group-buying sites such as Groupon use the network effect to increase buying power and obtain deals and discounts. Shopping discovery sites such as Pinterest allow users to suggest novel and exciting products and let merchants sell these products on the site (or app). Social shopping site Wanelo features 30 million products from 550,000 stores, allowing users to follow brands, stores, or other users and share their wish lists, allowing them to discover new styles or products. Recently, online customers have created their own form of social commerce; with the aim of bypassing traditional retail channels, online users have formed buying co-ops on social networks such as Facebook to purchase goods at wholesale prices. Clearly, while social commerce has various facets, it is certain that social aspects will play an ever-increasing role in e-commerce interactions.

## Benefits of E-tailing

For  e-tailers  and  customers  alike,  e-tailing  can  provide  many  benefits  over  traditional  brickand-mortar retailing in terms of the marketing concepts of product, place, and price. These are discussed next.

PRODUCT. Websites can offer a virtually unlimited number and variety of products because e-tailing is not limited by physical store and shelf space restrictions. For instance, e-tailer Amazon offers millions of book titles on the web compared with a local brick-and-mortar-only book retailer, which can offer 'only' a few thousand titles in a store because of the restricted physical space.

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## The Ethics of Reputation Management

if you're trying to decide on which book to purchase, which movie to watch at the theater, which hotel to stay at, or which restaurant to go to for dinner, you are likely to use the power of the crowd-that is, you probably consult websites such as Amazon (books), Rotten Tomatoes (movies), Tripadvisor or booking.com (hotels), or Yelp (restaurants) to read reviews from others. For consumers, online reviews can be a valuable decision aid. on the other hand, online reviews can make or break a business. For example, a restaurant receiving just a few negative reviews on Yelp during the pre-opening phase will be much less likely to attract diners in the future, and the restaurant may fail before it even started. For the restaurant owner, who has invested her life's savings, this would mean that she would have to declare bankruptcy; further, she may have to lay off the chef, the waitstaff, and the dishwasher, all of whom have families to feed. The owner is tempted to boost the reputation of the restaurant and thinks about composing a few reviews herself and publishing those under different pseudonyms. Alternatively, she is considering giving out free drinks or desserts to diners as an incentive for posting positive reviews.

a day after the book was released or reviews that sound suspiciously like marketing copy.

The restaurant owner thus faces a dilemma. on the one hand, she may just ignore the negative reviews and hope that diners keep coming in spite of these reviews; however, this may result in having to lay off all her staff and close the restaurant if customers are kept away by the reviews. on the other hand, she may engage in 'reputation management' and try to provide a more 'balanced' picture of her restaurant on the review site.

## Questions

1. What would you do? How about not providing any incentives but merely asking all satisfied customers to write reviews?
2. What would happen if the public found out about the owner's reputation management?
3. imagine the owner knew that the initial negative reviews were posted by a competitor trying to drive her out of business. Would this change your assessment? if so, how?

## based on:

needless to say, websites that publish customer reviews want to provide unbiased reviews and often have (proprietary) mechanisms in place to minimize (or at least reduce) the potential of biased reviews. in addition, under rules of the u.s. Federal Trade Commission, paying someone to post reviews may actually be illegal. Yet you may have noticed extensive, raving reviews about a 500-page book posted just

For online customers, comparison shopping is much easier on the web. In particular, numerous comparison-shopping services that focus on aggregating content are available to consumers. Some companies fulfilling this niche are Google Shopping, Shopping.com, and PriceGrabber (focusing on a wide range of products); AllBookstores.com (books); and Booking.com (hotel rooms). By displaying information about prices, sellers' ratings, or shipping options, these comparison-shopping sites can literally force sellers to focus on providing the best value in order to be successful. If sellers do not have the lowest price, they must be able to offer better quality, better service, or some other advantage. These comparison-shopping sites generate revenue by charging a small commission on transactions, by charging usage fees to sellers, and/or through advertising on their site.

PLACE. As company storefronts can (virtually) exist on every computer that is connected to the web, e-tailers can compete more effectively for customers, giving e-tailers an advantage. Whereas traditional retailers are bound to physical store locations and open hours, e-tailers can conduct business anywhere at any time.

The ubiquity of the internet has enabled companies to sell goods and services on a global scale. Consumers looking for a particular product are not limited to merchants from their own city or country; rather, they can search for the product where they are most likely to get it, where they may get the best quality, or where prices may be lowest. This has enabled customers to purchase goods from all over the world (such as various gadgets sold at www.dx.com). At the same time, this has created competition for domestic businesses, as overseas e-tailers

can often offer products much cheaper and may even offer free shipping (due to international postal agreements).

PRICE. E-tailers can also compete on price effectively as they can turn their inventory more often because of the sheer volume of products and customers who purchase them. Companies can sell more products, reducing prices for consumers while at the same time enhancing profits for the company. Further, virtual companies have no need to rent expensive retail space or employ sales clerks, allowing them to further reduce prices.

## Drawbacks of E-tailing

Despite all the hype associated with e-tailing, there are some downsides to this approach-in particular, issues associated with trust.

TRUST. One of the main factors keeping many consumers from purchasing goods and services online is trust. Especially for new online businesses, this tends to be challenging, as customers may be hesitant to purchase from companies they have never heard of. Often, trust becomes an issue due to the customer's inability to adequately experience the capabilities and characteristics of a product prior to purchase as well as due to uncertainties surrounding product delivery and returns.

Direct Product Experience For many products, customers desire not only information about product characteristics but also sensory information, such as taste, smell, and feel. When shopping for clothes at Lands' End, how can you be sure that you will like the feel of the material? Or what if you discover that the pair of size 9 EE hockey skates you just purchased online fits you like an 8 D? Likewise, products such as fragrances and foods can be difficult for consumers to assess via the web. Does the strawberry cheesecake offered online actually taste as good as it looks? How do you know if you will really like the smell of a perfume without actually sampling it? Finally, e-tailing eliminates the social aspects of the purchase. Although online retailers such as Amazon have contributed to the demise of traditional shopping malls, many physical stores still thrive, as interacting with a knowledgeable salesperson cannot be replicated online. On the other hand, online shopping provides certain anonymity, allowing people to shop for products they may not feel comfortable buying in a physical retail store.

Product Delivery and Returns Except for digital products, such as music, games, or electronic magazines, e-tailing requires additional time for products to be delivered. If you have run out of ink for your printer and your research paper is due this afternoon, chances are that you will visit your local office supply store to purchase a new ink cartridge rather than ordering it online. The ink cartridge purchased electronically needs to be packaged and shipped, delaying use of the product until it is delivered. To combat these issues, large online retailers now offer 1-day delivery or, as is the case with Amazon's Prime Now, 2-hour delivery in select cities. Similarly, many click-and-mortar businesses offer in-store pickup and ship-from-store services to address issues associated with product delivery and to effectively compete with click-only companies. Other issues can also arise. The credit card information that you provided online may not be approved, or the shipper may try to deliver the package when you are not home. Finally, the customer may be unsure about product returns in case the product is not of the expected size or quality. When purchasing goods offline, people can easily return the product to the store; likewise, many click-and-mortar retailers offer in-store returns. However, when interacting with a click-only company, customers will have to carefully follow the merchant's instructions to receive a replacement or refund, leading to uncertainties for the customer. These issues become even more problematic when conducting transactions across national borders.

## Electronic Commerce Websites and Internet Marketing

The basic rules of commerce are to offer valuable products and services at fair prices; a sound underlying business model is key for a successful business both online and offline. However, as is the case with effects of retail store layout and design on offline purchasing behavior, the design of an online retailer's website influences online purchasing behavior. In addition, to be successful,

companies in the digital world must market their products or services across a variety of online channels. These topics are discussed next.

## Designing Websites to Meet Online Consumers' Needs

Successful companies design their websites to enhance their online customers' experience when interacting with the website.   Valacich, Parboteeah, and Wells (2007) found that online consumers' needs can be categorized in terms of the site's structural firmness (characteristics that influence the website's security and performance), functional convenience (characteristics that make the interaction with the website easier or more convenient), and representational delight (characteristics that stimulate a consumer's senses). These are discussed next.

Structural Firmness For websites to be successful, structural firmness is a must. Online customers are unlikely to trust and revisit a website (let alone make a transaction) if the website does not function well (at least reasonably well). For example, the website should not have (or at least minimize) bad links, should provide understandable error messages should something go wrong, and should ensure privacy and security of the customers' data (EC websites often use trust seals to signal that privacy and security are ensured). Further, the website should be fast; if online customers have to wait for pages to load, they are not apt to stay at the site long or to return. In fact, studies suggest that the average length of time that a web surfer will wait for a web page to load is only a couple of seconds.

Functional Convenience The website must be easy to use. As with nearly all software, websites that are easy to use are more popular. If visitors have trouble finding things on a page

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Too Small to Be Hacked?

stealing secret data is only valuable if someone is willing to pay for it, and one of the challenges facing cybercriminals is how to turn their exploits into hard currency. in recent years, many cybercriminals have turned to stealing data that can be easily converted into hard currency. Credit card numbers can be used directly to purchase merchandise or gift cards until the theft gets reported and the account canceled. Personal data can be used to steal someone's identity to apply for loans to get cash. However, as consumers, retailers, and banks get better at recognizing illicit activity and preventing data theft, it is getting more difficult for cybercriminals to monetize their activities. A recent trend has been taking data hostage.

many small to medium-sized businesses lack the sophistication and resources to adequately protect their information systems. The data contained in these systems, however, are usually of limited value to others outside the business. so, instead of stealing the data, cybercriminals lock it up in such a way that it cannot be accessed. usually, instead of transferring the data out, criminals simply encrypt the data in place. Without properly designed backup systems, many businesses are unable to access or recover their data. The cybercriminals then demand a ransom payment to restore access to the data. A small business's data may not be valuable to others, but the data are often extremely important to the operation of the business. Without extensive iT support or sophistication, the owners of the business may be willing to pay the ransom to regain access to their data, thus providing immediate income to the criminals. unfortunately, paying off the criminals may or may not get the data back, and the vulnerabilities that led to the attack in the first place may still be in place.

To prevent becoming a victim in the first place, experts recommend paying for a third-party service to audit, enhance, and maintain system security. While a small business may not be able to afford a sophisticated staff and specialized technology to monitor and secure its information systems, there are many outsourcing providers that can provide the required expertise and capabilities for a reasonable fee. As with many types of risks, an ounce of prevention can be worth a pound of cure. security audits and enhancements are only part of the equation, however. it is also important to ensure that proper backup and disaster recovery policies and procedures are in place and to test them regularly. Finally, users are a key part of the equation. Technology alone cannot protect a business if the system user is the weak link, so it is essential to train users to recognize phishing scams and not to perform risky actions like clicking on unknown links or executing unknown attachments that can contain malware.

based on:

Popper, n. (2020, February 9). Ransomware attacks grow, crippling cities and businesses. The New York Times. Retrieved June 10, 2020, from   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/technology/ransomwareattacks.html

or navigating through the website's links, they are unlikely to make a transaction or return to the site. Thus, websites should provide easy navigation for users to find their way (and back), provide indications about where the users are on the site, and offer help features. Further, features such as one-click ordering, offering a variety of payment methods, or order tracking can increase the perceived functional convenience of a website.

Representational Delight Finally, the website must be aesthetically pleasing. People are more likely to visit, stay at, and return to a website that looks good, as the design of a website can signal other characteristics of an online business, such as professionalism (Wells, Valacich, &amp; Hess, 2011). Thus, successful firms have websites that are nice to look at and have a unique look and feel to separate their website from their competition. Aesthetics can include the use of color schemes, fonts, backgrounds, and high-quality images. Furthermore, websites should have a clear, concise, and consistent layout, taking care to avoid unnecessary clutter.

THE ONLINE CONSUMERS' HIERARCHY OF NEEDS. In a perfect world, an organization would strive to maximize all three sets of characteristics. In reality, businesses constantly have to make trade-offs between complexity, resource limitations, and other factors; thus, it is important to understand online consumers' relative needs. Valacich and colleagues' (2007) 'online consumer's hierarchy of needs' suggests that, overall, a site's structural firmness is most critical; once visitors' needs for structural firmness have been met, functional convenience is the next most important set of characteristics, followed by representational delight. In other words, if a website is only nice to look at but difficult to navigate or appears not secure, visitors are unlikely to stay or make a transaction.

Needless to say, a basic level of structural firmness, functional convenience, and representational delight should be provided by any website (in other words, online visitors have a 'zone of intolerance'). Beyond this basic level, the importance of the different sets of characteristics depends on the objective of a particular page on a website (Figure 4.9). For example, for a very utilitarian web page, such as the login page of your online banking site, structural firmness should be emphasized to the user (though both functional convenience and representational delight should not be neglected). In contrast, for a relatively more hedonic web page, such as a page designed to engage a visitor into considering a new home loan, representational delight should be emphasized (again, not neglecting the other factors). Hybrid pages, offering both hedonic and utilitarian value, such as those within Amazon or eBay, should balance the different factors (though typically checkout pages on such sites emphasize aspects related to structural firmness).

SETTING UP YOUR ONLINE STORE. As numerous examples show, the web allows almost anyone to set up an online store. The first step in starting a B2C e-commerce business is to set up an online storefront that is easy to use, fast, reliable, and aesthetically pleasing. However, especially small companies often lack the resources to set up a professional e-commerce site. One solution for companies wanting to benefit from being associated with large, successful e-businesses is to turn to the e-commerce giants eBay and Amazon, which let others sell products on their sites

Scanning a QR code can trigger certain actions, such as opening a web page. source: oleksiy mark/shutterstock on a large scale. In addition, online businesses can choose from various (often freely available) e-commerce solutions that offer numerous well-designed store templates. E-commerce solutions offered by commercial providers such as Intuit, GoDaddy, Shopify, or Yahoo! or open source solutions such as osCommerce or PrestaShop offer various store templates, an integrated shopping cart, and so on; typically, such e-commerce solutions are customizable, giving businesses the option of integrating customer reviews, reward programs, or tracking information.

An additional challenge for fledgling online merchants is the effort involved in picking, packing, and shipping the orders. To address this problem, many smaller companies choose to outsource order fulfillment. For example, Fulfillment by Amazon 'rents out' warehouse and information systems infrastructure to anyone wanting to run a successful online business, essentially offering fulfilment as a service, where all a company must do is ship the products (in bulk) to Amazon's warehouses, where the products will be stored until an order is received. Employees from the fulfillment service then pick, pack, and ship the order, allowing the companies to concentrate on managing the online business, attracting new customers, and so on.

## Internet Marketing

One fundamental mistake companies can make when taking a current business online or creating an online business is assuming that if you build it, they will come. As with an offline business, marketing is a critical activity in any online endeavor, and a website cannot be successful without customers. As companies must attract visitors to their site and away from the thousands of other sites they could be visiting, companies advertise their firm's web presence by including the website address on all company materials, from business cards and letterheads to advertising copy. Further, it is now common to see a company's URL listed at the end of its television commercials, and more and more companies integrate QR codes into their offline ads. QR codes are two-dimensional bar codes with a high storage capacity. In a consumer context, QR codes are typically used to point the consumer to a particular web page when he or she scans the bar code with a mobile device's camera (Figure 4.10). Alternatively, QR codes can trigger certain actions, such as initiating a phone call to a sales representative or sending a text message to a prespecified number. In addition, QR codes are increasingly used for contactless mobile payments through banking apps or payment services such as PayPal or the Chinese payment services Alipay or WeChat Pay.

Historically, companies' advertising budgets were mostly spent on noninteractive advertising campaigns, such as using billboards or newspaper, radio, or television ads. However, as people are accessing the internet multiple times a day from multiple devices and locations, companies are reallocating their advertising budgets; research firm Forrester estimates that by 2023,

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

companies will spend US$150 billion on internet marketing, including search marketing, display ads, email marketing, social media, and mobile marketing (VanBoskirk, 2019). All of these are discussed next.

SEARCH MARKETING. Whereas people would traditionally obtain information about products or companies from offline sources, many web surfers now just enter the name of a product into a search engine such as Google or Bing and then visit the resulting pages. Given this trend, it is not surprising that search marketing is now big business. Research firm Statista forecasts that by 2023, companies in the United States will spend US$86 billion on search marketing (Figure 4.11). Included in search marketing are search engine optimization and paid search, both of which are discussed next.

Search Engine Optimization The results presented by search engines such as Google or Bing are typically separated into organic results (i.e., based on the page's content) and sponsored results. The organic results of a user's search are presented based on complex, proprietary formulas, and the ranking (position of the link to a particular page) in the search results is largely outside the control of the web page's owner (Figure 4.12). Given the incredible numbers of results that are returned for common searches such as 'apparel,' 'sportswear,' or

'digital camera,' most surfers visit only the first few links that are presented and rarely venture beyond the first page of the search results; thus, companies use search engine optimization (SEO) in an attempt to boost their ranking in the organic search engine results. Although the exact formulas for a web page's rank in the organic results of a search engine are kept as trade secrets, the major search engines give tips on how to optimize a page's ranking, including providing unique and valuable content, keeping the content updated, and including key words for which a user might query.

There are a multitude of companies promising to improve a page's ranking, but because the algorithms used by the major search engines are usually proprietary and are frequently changed and there can be literally hundreds of factors influencing a page's rank, the success of using such services is often limited. Further, search engines such as Google try to detect whether a page is using unethical 'tricks' (such as 'hidden' key words) to improve its ranking and ban sites using such tricks from the listing altogether. Nevertheless, even slight modifications to a page can have a large impact on the page's ranking in search results, and investments in SEO are often worthwhile, especially in times of tight marketing budgets.

Paid Search A way to ensure that your company's page appears on the first page users see when searching for a specific term is using search advertising (or sponsored search ). For example, using Google's 'AdWords,' a company can bid for being listed in the sponsored search results for the term '4K TV' (Figure 4.13). To present the most relevant ads to its users, Google then determines the relevance of the ad and the content of the linked page to the search term, and, depending on the amount of the bid, the company's web page is listed in the sponsored results; Google is paid on a pay-per-click basis (see the following discussion of pricing models). As you can imagine, this can quickly become very expensive for advertisers, especially when the sponsored link is associated with a popular search term, and the advertiser must bid against many competitors. On the other hand, a system such as Google's AdWords ensures high-quality leads, as the ads are presented only to users searching for a specific key word (in contrast to traditional ads, which are presented to anyone). As programs such as AdWords can be tweaked in myriad ways (such as by key words, negative key words, region, time of day, and so on), many companies turn to professional consultants who help to optimize sponsored search campaigns. Alternatively, some search engines offer to elevate a page's position in the organic results after

paying a fee ( paid inclusion ). Many search engines that pride themselves on offering unbiased results (such as Google), however, do not offer paid inclusion.

DISPLAY ADS. In the early days of the web, display advertising was the prevalent form of online advertising. Like traditional newspaper ads, companies would advertise their presence on other popular websites, such as nytimes.com, using static banner ads, video ads, or interactive banner ads, which allow users to interact with the advertisement. A recent trend in display advertising has been contextual advertising, where the ads placed on a page are in some way related to the content of that page. If, for example, you are reading tournament results from a PGA golf event at a popular sports website such as espn.com, you will also likely see an advertisement to buy new golf equipment or to visit a golf resort. A variety of interactive features, rich media ads, and the ability to place ads in online videos (on sites such as YouTube or Facebook-sometimes referred to as instream video ads ) as well as the ability to accurately measure an ad's impact contribute to display advertising's increasing popularity.

EMAIL MARKETING. Email marketing has been, and continues to be, a very popular aspect of advertisers' overall interactive marketing mix. Given the low cost of less than US$1 per 1,000 emails, advertisers are increasingly trying to move away from direct-mail advertising and replace it with email advertising. In addition to low cost, email marketing campaigns can be effectively automated, and the effectiveness of email advertising campaigns can be measured directly (such as by including special links or images in the email that allow the sender to track which emails the recipients have opened or reacted to). Further, email marketing saves tremendous amounts of paper over traditional direct mail advertising, allowing a company to build a positive green image.

SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING. One continuing trend in internet marketing is harnessing the power of social media, such as Facebook or Twitter. As people rely on social media to stay in contact with their friends or business associates, including such sites in the interactive marketing mix is a natural move for companies. In addition to placing display ads on such sites, companies increasingly use social networking sites for interactive communication with their customers. For example, the Coca-Cola Company has created a page on Facebook, allowing it to interact with its more than 106 million 'fans' (i.e., Facebook users who 'like' the page) in various ways; Coke's fans can download free virtual goodies, upload pictures related to everything Coke, or use interactive apps. By creating this page (which is free for Coke, except for the time needed to set it up, monitor it, and maintain it), Coke can build strong relationships with a large group of its target customers. Similarly, people can follow Coke on Twitter or visit Coke's channel on the video-sharing site YouTube. A recent trend for companies is establishing 'social media listening centers' to feel the pulse of public opinion across a variety of social media. We discuss social media marketing in more detail in Chapter 5, 'Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media.'

MOBILE MARKETING. Finally, the ubiquitous use of smartphones and tablets has provided marketers with yet another channel for highly targeted advertising (such as based on a user's location). This is true especially for tablets (with their relatively large screens), which allow for various innovative interactive ad formats. Further, placing ads into mobile phone apps allows app developers to offer apps for lower prices (or free, under the freemium model; see Chapter 2) and provides marketers with another opportunity to reach their target audience through their favorite channels. Finally, the growth in mobile commerce further contributes to the growth of mobile marketing, as companies are trying to reach their customers wherever, whenever.

PRICING MODELS IN INTERNET MARKETING. In offline advertising, an ad's exposure can only be guessed and pricing is typically fixed. For example, the cost for renting an outdoor billboard is determined by the size of the billboard, the location, or the estimated number of cars passing by that billboard in a certain time period; likewise, the price for a newspaper ad is determined by the ad's size, the paper's circulation, and so on. On the web, in contrast, it is possible to determine exactly how many people have been exposed to or clicked on an ad. Thus, one common pricing model for online advertising is the impression based model ; under this model, pricing is based on the number of times the page containing an ad is displayed, typically expressed in cost per thousand impressions (i.e., cost per mille, or CPM). Depending on advertising volume and the popularity of the site where the ad is placed, costs can range from US$8 to US$40 per thousand

impressions. However, research firms estimate that between 30 and 60 percent of website visits may be generated by nonhuman traffic; further, many web surfers do not even look at the online ads and web browsers such as Firefox offer the option to block certain ads. Thus, the trend in web advertising is moving toward performance-based pricing models, where the return on investment is more direct, such as pay-per-click models . Under this type of pricing model, the firm running the advertisement pays only when a web surfer actually clicks on the advertisement; the cost is typically between US$0.01 and US$0.50 per click, depending on the site, its viewers, and so on. One drawback, however, of pay-per-click models is the possibility of abuse by repeatedly clicking on a link to inflate revenue to the host or increase the costs for the advertiser; this is known as click fraud . Click fraud has become increasingly problematic, and companies such as Google are constantly monitoring clicks to detect potentially fraudulent activity.

CONTENT MARKETING. Paid digital marketing approaches such as search marketing, display advertising, or mobile marketing can be characterized as 'push marketing,' where products or ads are pushed to an audience that may or may not be interested; a marketer essentially 'rents' the attention of the audience. In contrast, 'pull marketing' attempts to 'earn' the interest of the audience and draw the audience to the product or service. Content marketing is a way to attract an audience by providing relevant and valuable content through various channels. Typical content marketing approaches include creating how-tos, white papers, infographics, e-books, or other content that the target audience might find useful, with the aim of creating brand recognition and positioning oneself as a thought leader. While the creation of valuable content involves considerable effort, it is often regarded as having a high return on investment.

ASSESSING PERFORMANCE OF INTERNET MARKETING. One major benefit of internet marketing is the ability to target specific recipients based on location, time of day, page content surrounding an ad, or the viewer's demographics, 'likes,' or interests (e.g., on a social network such as

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## Buying Likes

We've all seen them in our social network feeds: 'like this page for a chance to win a cash prize' or 'share this link to help John Doe get a backstage pass to the concert!' social media sites like Facebook are a great platform for businesses to generate buzz and, with a well-executed marketing campaign, get noticed by millions of users. many businesses entice users to 'like' their business page for some reward-a discount or chance to win a prize-and in turn, the users who 'like' the business spread the word to each of their network connections automatically. users of Twitter and instagram can also promote topics or businesses using hashtags (keywords denoted with a '#' symbol  ; see Chapter   5  ). These campaigns used to be very effective. For example, in 2015, starbucks hosted a photo contest in which participants who posted a photograph with a red starbucks cup could win us$500. To be eligible to win, the contestants had to post the picture on instagram along with the hashtag #RedCupContest. This simple campaign resulted in more than 40,000 entries competing for one of five prizes.

now, however, these campaigns and contests can be deeply biased by automated 'likes' and submissions, giving unfair advantage to users who try to game the system. There are many services that offer 'like buying' and other forms of electronic voting fraud. some of these companies use special software to spoof and rapidly change their iP address, preventing filtering from contest sponsors who try to prevent multiple votes from the same iP address or who limit valid entries to only those within a specified geographical region. These 'Click Farms,' where companies employ dozens of people whose job is to use a multitude of social media accounts to 'like,' follow, vote for, or otherwise promote whatever campaign their clients hire them to promote, are rapidly being targeted for removal by social media platforms. Just last year Facebook removed more than 2 billion fake accounts in just a few months.

social media platforms will continue to try to suppress this type of devious behavior, but, as with many such practices, it turns into a cat-and-mouse game with both the social networks and the fraudsters constantly finding new ways to outsmart the other. Do a search for 'buying likes' online and see who is currently ahead.

Facebook), making internet marketing campaigns very effective; further, in contrast to traditional marketing campaigns, it is easy to assess viewer's reactions to an ad. Given that Google and Facebook know (or are able to infer) various characteristics of their users (and Google manages ads across a variety of partner websites ranging from AOL to the Washington Post ), it comes as no surprise that these two companies reap 85 cents of each new online advertising dollar spent by companies, according to analysts. How is the success of internet marketing campaigns measured? The performance of internet marketing can be assessed by metrics such as click-through rate , reflecting the number of surfers who click on an ad (i.e., clicks) divided by the number of times it was displayed (i.e., impressions), or conversion rate , reflecting the percentage of visitors who actually perform the marketer's desired action (such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, watching a video, and so on). Targeting a well-defined audience with an ad campaign can help to attract high-quality leads, ultimately resulting in higher conversion rates. In addition, tracking visitors' behavior on a website can provide a host of useful information. For example, a firm can track the path that visitors take through the many pages of its website and record the length of the visits, page views, common entry pages, a page's bounce rate and exit rate, and even the user's region, browser, or internet service provider, among other statistics. Exit rate is defined as the percentage of visitors who leave the website (i.e., terminate the session) after viewing that page; in other words, it reflects the percentage of users for whom a particular page is the last page they view before moving on to a different site or closing their browser window. In contrast, bounce rate is defined as the percentage of single-page visits; in other words, it reflects the percentage of users for whom a particular page is the only page visited on the website during a session. As the different metrics can be affected by the page itself as well as by the quality of the traffic being attracted, the company can use this information to improve its website or attempt to attract higher-quality traffic. If the exit rate for a page is abnormally high, the company can try to find out why this occurs and redesign the page to entice the users to stay. Similarly, pages that go unused can be eliminated from the site, reducing maintenance and upkeep. This process of analyzing web surfers' behavior to improve website performance (and, ultimately, maximize sales) is known as web analytics (for more on this topic, see Case 1 at the end of this chapter and Chapter 6).

## Mobile Commerce, Voice Commerce, Consumer-toConsumer EC, and Consumer-to-Business EC

Fueled by increasing digital density, mobile commerce has seen tremendous growth in the past few years. As defined earlier in the chapter, m-commerce is any electronic transaction or information interaction conducted using a wireless, mobile device and mobile networks (wireless or switched public network) that leads to the transfer of real or perceived value in exchange for information, services, or goods (MobileInfo, 2016).

Powerful mobile devices such as Apple's iPhone and iPad or Samsung's Galaxy, supporting high-speed data transfer and 'always-on' connectivity, provide a wide variety of services and capabilities in addition to voice communication, such as multimedia data transfer, video streaming, video telephony, a sheer unlimited number of useful apps, and full internet access, allowing consumers to access information or make transactions on the go. Mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Alipay, and others further facilitate mobile commerce. Indeed, research firm Statista expected retail m-commerce sales in the United States to increase from US$207   billion in 2018 to US$338 billion in 2020 (Clement, 2019). While in 2019, m-commerce reach in the United States was 37 percent, in other regions of the world, mobile commerce has an even larger impact, with an m-commerce reach of 64 percent in China and 80 percent in Indonesia (Clement, 2020).

The increasing use of tablets is seen as another major driver of mobile commerce. Although providing for mobility, tablets are often used in people's living rooms as 'couch computers'; thus, tablets allow people to shop from the comfort of their homes without being tied to a desk and a computer screen (Figure 4.14). In addition, tablets provide larger screen sizes, allowing for better product presentation. An analysis of 16.2 billion transactions from 150 online retailers showed that tablet users tend to spend significantly more per order than shoppers using smartphones or personal computers (Adobe, 2012); with the increasing sophistication of tablets, this finding is likely to continue to hold. Given that tablet users tend to have above-average incomes, tablets may be the perfect channel for selling products or services online.

LOCATION-BASED M-COMMERCE. Another key driver for m-commerce is location-based services , which are highly personalized mobile services based on a user's location. Locationbased services are implemented via the cellular network, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks, and global positioning system (GPS) functionality of the users' smartphones. Location-based services allow the service provider to offer information or services tailored to the users' needs, depending on their location. For example, search engines can provide specific information about attractions or restaurants located in the user's vicinity, retail stores can enhance store locators with navigation instructions, or users can receive real-time traffic or public transport information (Table 4.2).

INFORMATION ON THE GO. In the digital world, people have become increasingly used to having tremendous amounts of information available. Mobile devices have taken this to the next level, in that people now have the information available whenever, wherever (Figure 4.15). For instance, when deciding on whether to visit a particular restaurant, people can get further information or customer reviews from sites such as Yelp using their mobile devices; similarly, when standing in a retail store, customers can easily retrieve a host of information and reviews about particular products. For customers, this capability can help tremendously when making purchase decisions; for companies operating in the offline world, this has turned into a mixed blessing. On the one hand, they can augment the offline shopping experience by being able to provide much more information than they would typically be able to, which can open up many opportunities for cross-channel and multichannel retailing and can allow bricks-and-clicks retailers to compete with their clickonly counterparts. On the other hand, the rise in smartphone use has led to showrooming -that is, shoppers coming into a store to evaluate the look and feel of a product to then purchase it online or at a competitor's store. Obviously, click-only companies benefit from this practice; online retailer Amazon even offers an app that lets the user scan a product's

bar code with the smartphone's camera and then displays the product information and price offered by Amazon.

In addition to providing information on the go, many service providers offer mobile tickets or mobile boarding passes; typically a QR code is sent to the smartphone of the user, who then just has to present the code to a QR code reader to verify the ticket or boarding pass. This adds convenience for the user, who does not have to keep track of paper tickets, physical boarding passes, and the like, and the service provider can offer additional information and services, such as automatic notifications of delays or gate changes for passengers.

PRODUCT AND CONTENT SALES. Mobile users increasingly use their mobile devices to purchase products or content on the go. For organizations, optimizing their online presence for mobile users has thus become increasingly important (since 2019, Google has modified its approach to indexing web pages, such that the algorithm assesses the relevance of the mobile site, rather than the desktop site, for indexing and ranking pages). With the increasing popularity of mobile commerce, companies must strategically decide whether to go beyond mobile versions of their websites and create dedicated mobile apps, which can offer many features that cannot be provided on mobile websites. However, mobile apps are typically costly to develop as they must be tailored to different platforms (e.g., Apple's iOS versus Android) and device form factors (such as different screen sizes of smartphones and tablets) (Figure 4.16). In any case, firms operating in the digital world should accommodate for unique aspects of mobile interactions (e.g., interactions are often short and fragmented, or users face frequent distractions). According to research firm EPiServer, mobile users regard user reviews, direct customer support, adaptation to different screen sizes, location-based functions, and wish list functions as the most important features of mobile retail sites (eMarketer, 2016).

Especially among commuters, accessing content from mobile devices is extremely popular. Content providers ranging from newspapers to TV stations are now offering various ways to access their content from mobile devices. The increasing field of mobile content is obviously an

important part of many companies' mobile marketing mix, as it allows reaching people in more places and provides for extremely targeted marketing efforts (e.g., based on a user's location).

## Voice Commerce

Increasing processing power of devices and advances in AI, paired with fast connectivity, have enabled rapid improvements of voice recognition technologies, such that we are seeing a rise in so-called natural user interfaces that extend beyond traditional screens and keyboards. Initially integrated into smartphones, smart voice assistants (such as Apple's Siri or Samsung's Bixby) have become increasingly popular in people's homes, with the home assistants Amazon Alexa and Google Home being integrated into a variety of devices (such as smart speakers). Especially for frequently purchased items, voice commerce offers a convenient way of making purchases. With Amazon being a behemoth in the world of e-commerce, it is no wonder that the battle for market domination has shifted from web to mobile, and is now shifting to AI and voice, and Amazon is tightly integrating Alexa with its e-commerce platform.

## C2C EC

C2C commerce has been with us since the start of commerce itself. Whether it was bartering, auctions,  or  tendering,  commerce  has  always  included  C2C  economics.  Electronically  facilitated  interactions  create  unique  opportunities  (such  as  a  large  pool  of  potential  buyers)  and unique problems (such as the potential of being defrauded; see Table 4.3). This section discusses e-auctions and online classifieds ,  two of the most popular mechanisms consumers use to buy, sell, and trade with other consumers.

E-AUCTIONS. E-auctions provide a place where sellers can post goods and services for sale and buyers can bid on these items. Relatedly, bartering typically takes place on a one-on-one basis, but websites such as swap.com bring together many people listing items to swap.

## TABLE 4.3 Opportunities and Threats of C2C EC

The largest e-auction site, as you probably know, is eBay (https://www.ebay.com). eBay's revenue model is based on small fees that are associated with posting items, but these small fees quickly add up, so that in 2019, eBay's net revenues exceeded US$10.8 billion. Whereas eBay is hugely popular, there continue to be cases of fraud. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (2020), e-auctions are marred with fraud, with non-shipment of goods being among the top five most common crime types filed with the center; further, with the proliferation of fake goods ranging from handbags to brake pads, air bags, and chain saws, purchasing and using counterfeit goods can not only lead to legal complications but can potentially have dangerous or even deadly consequences. Needless to say, online auction sites warn users to exercise caution when purchasing goods; in addition, e-auction providers such as eBay offer swift conflict resolution mechanisms to preserve people's trust in the marketplace and use sophisticated business intelligence applications (see Chapter 6) to detect and minimize e-auction fraud, attempting to make C2C EC a safer shopping experience.

ONLINE CLASSIFIEDS. Another type of C2C e-commerce is online classifieds. Although online classifieds sites such as craigslist.com are enabled by web capabilities, no transactions take place online. Yet online classifieds have flourished in recent years, enabling people to sell anything from flowers to furniture. A related concept that has gained popularity is 'freecycling,' that is, giving away goods for free to anyone who is willing to pick them up.

PLATFORM-BASED C2C BUSINESS MODELS. As discussed in Chapter 2, digital platforms enable users to co-create value, and fueled by the megatrends social and mobile, many platforms focus on enabling C2C interactions. For example, ride-sharing platforms such as Uber or Lyft allow everyday people to use their own vehicles to provide an alternative to traditional cabs. Likewise, Airbnb allows people to rent their apartments to others, C2C marketplaces such as Etsy allow individuals to sell vintage or handmade products to other consumers, and the mobile photosharing service Instagram enables people to easily set up online storefronts.

## C2B EC

Just as the web has enabled small businesses to participate in global EC, it has also enabled consumers to sell goods or services to businesses, reversing the more typical B2C model. Consumerto-business (C2B) EC has seen a few implementations. One prime example is microstock photo sites  such  as  Shutterstock,  which  sell  pictures,  videos,  or  artwork  to  publishers,  newspapers, web designers, or advertising agencies. Up until a few years ago, clearinghouses such as Getty Images were the primary source for stock photography used by advertisers, book publishers such as Pearson, or publishers of newspapers or magazines; however, the images purchased from these clearinghouses tended to be expensive, as the clearinghouses sourced the pictures from professional photographers. In contrast, Shutterstock sources much of its content not from professionals but from amateur photographers (Figure 4.17). Today, high-quality digital cameras can be had for far less than US$1,000, and with the right editing software, amateur photographers can create images that almost match those of professional photographers. Amateur photographers can upload their pictures to microstock photo sites, where interested parties can license and download the images for US$1 to US$5 per image, which is a fraction of the price of a regular stock photo. Given that overhead costs are almost negligible, the microstock photo sites can make a

profit while still sharing part of the revenue with the pictures' creators. Similarly, companies use crowdsourcing on micro-task marketplaces such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (see Chapter 5) to have small, well-defined tasks (such as tagging pictures or describing products) completed by a scalable ad hoc workforce of everyday people. However, it can be argued that consumers who regularly engage in C2B transactions and make parts of their living with such transactions can be considered businesses; hence, the line between C2B and B2B transactions is somewhat blurry.

## Securing Payments and Navigating Legal Issues in EC

Within a short period of time, radical developments in technology and systems have brought EC from a fringe economic activity to one of the most prevalent in today's global economy. This innovation has not slowed down and has opened some promising new areas within EC. This section outlines web-based financial transactions and legal issues related to engaging in EC.

## Securing Payments in the Digital World

One of the most crucial aspects of B2C EC, C2C EC, and m-commerce is ensuring that online transactions are secure. Although the transfer of money is a critical factor in online shopping, online banking, and online investing, security researchers and software companies are lamenting that people are often reluctant to change their habits when surfing the web and carelessly reveal sensitive information to unknown or fraudulent sites. In fact, 17.7 million residents of the United States (or 10 percent of U.S. adults) became victims of identity theft in 2016 (see Chapter 10). Security concerns and other factors (such as impatience, lengthy checkout procedures, or comparison shopping) lead shoppers to frequently abandon their shopping carts and to not follow through with a purchase-reports show that more than half of the online shopping carts are abandoned. Traditionally, paying for goods and services was limited to using credit and debit cards, but using these methods can open up many security issues. To address these issues, there are now different ways of exchanging funds when buying and selling goods or services online. Issues related to different forms of online payment are discussed next.

PAYMENT SERVICES. Concerns for security have led to the inception of independent payment services such as PayPal (owned by eBay), Apple Pay, Square, or Google Wallet. These services allow online customers to purchase goods online without having to reveal much private information to the actual sellers. Rather than paying a seller by providing credit card information, an online shopper can simply pay by using his or her account with the payment service. Thus, the customer has to provide the (sensitive) payment information only to the payment service, which keeps this information secure (along with other information such as email address or purchase history) and does not share it with the online merchant. Google linked its payment service to the search results so that internet users looking for a specific product can immediately see whether a merchant offers this payment option; this is intended to ease the online shopping experience for consumers, thus reducing the number of people abandoning their shopping carts. Another payment service, PayPal, goes a step further by allowing anyone with an email address to send and receive money. In other words, using this service, you can send money to your friends or family members, or you can receive money for anything you're selling. This easy way to transfer money has been instrumental in the success of eBay, where anyone can sell or buy goods from other eBay users. With the increase in mobile interactions, mobile payment services such as Apple Pay or Square are seeing an increase in popularity. Such services greatly facilitate making in-store payments and offer an alternative to carrying cash or credit cards (e.g., by allowing the user to pay for a cup of coffee using a smartphone). A recent development of mobile payment services is to allow for peer-to-peer payments, such that a group of friends could easily split the bill for a meal at a restaurant. For example, the hugely successful Chinese messaging platform WeChat not only allows making online and offline payments but also allows for peer-to-peer transactions.

CRYPTOCURRENCIES. One radical innovation around making and receiving payments is cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies (the most widely used being Bitcoin) are virtual currencies that are not issued by any central bank and use encryption technologies to secure transactions and to generate new units of the currency. Often described as being primarily used for illicit purposes

## GREEN IT

## Green Online Shopping

Have you ever spent endless hours in different stores looking for a particular item? unless the different stores are located in the same mall (or in the same general vicinity), driving between the stores requires using fossil fuels and contributes to increased pollution and road traffic. When shopping online, in contrast, you can easily search for products at different stores and compare prices, availability, shipping options, and so on, so you only need energy to power the device you use for your online 'shopping trip.'

unfortunately, calculating the environmental impact of online shopping versus shopping in a brick-and-mortar store is not always easy. Products purchased online are typically delivered by companies such as uPs or DHl; as the delivery vans travel optimized routes and deliver packages destined for hundreds of other people, they potentially save hundreds of trips taken to a store. likewise, stores do not have to print out and handle paper receipts and other paperwork, lowering the need for chopping down trees. on the other hand, incredible amounts of cardboard boxes are needed to prevent damage to the items in transit.

choose the fastest delivery option, or the slowest? Do you have multiple purchases delivered together, or separately so you can receive our goods faster? slower and bundled deliveries reduce carbon emissions in comparison to faster, single item deliveries. it is also more than two times more efficient to buy online from local vendors instead of having items shipped longer distances.

The effects of increased emissions and road traffic can especially be felt in large cities such as london, which expects delivery van traffic to increase by 20 percent until 2030with this increase being entirely due to online shopping. As a result, cities are encouraging alternative energy to power these vans. For example, the city of london is providing subsidies to gnewt Cargo, a company operating an all-electric delivery fleet that has saved 500 tons of carbon dioxide as of late 2019. While this is not going to reduce congestion, it can at least help make online shopping a little greener.

## based on:

Recent research suggests that online shopping might not be that green after all due to the way in which we, as consumers, make our buying decisions. The comparison is not always easy, as offline shoppers often bundle their purchases (e.g., by going to big box stores or shopping malls), online shopping may actually stimulate additional consumption (and thus need for transporting items), and delivery vehicles are often only a quarter full (as estimated by london's transport authority). Think about your own online shopping preferences. Do you

(such as dealing with drugs or weapons), these cryptocurrencies have various useful legitimate applications. Most of us are comfortable with providing credit card information to a reputable online retailer such as Amazon or NewEgg. Likewise, many of us have purchased things from other individuals or small companies using a payment service like PayPal. Credit card companies and payment services like PayPal act as trusted middlemen and provide consumers a safety net, giving them the confidence that their purchase will produce the desired good or service and ensuring that their personal financial information remains confidential. These services, however, come at a significant cost. Credit card companies charge vendors between 1 and 3 percent of the purchase amount of every transaction, a cost that is typically passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. Payment services such as PayPal also charge fees, which can be as high as several percentage points of the total price.

In contrast, the technology underlying Bitcoin requires no trusted middleman, reducing the transaction costs to negligible amounts. Thus, Bitcoin is very useful for everything from micropayments to international transfers. In fact, many major online companies (including Dell, Expedia, and   Overstock.com  ) as well as offline retailers now provide ways for customers to pay with Bitcoin. In addition to extremely low transaction fees, Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, akin to cash payments. How does Bitcoin work?

Bitcoin was launched around the year 2008 by an anonymous developer pseudo-named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is transferred as payment within a completely decentralized peerto-peer payment network-the payment processing is handled by thousands of computers around the world, each running the open source Bitcoin software. When someone pays for

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Digital Payments

The advent of the credit card and electronic funds transfer (EFT) mechanisms have paved the way for cashless societies. Although the use of cashless payments is on the rise, there are still various scenarios in which using EFT or credit card payments are expensive, cumbersome, or downright impossible. For example, many retailers resist accepting credit cards due to the high transaction costs involved, especially for small purchases. Further, even the most recently developed peer-to-peer (P2P) EFT payment technology (e.g., Zelle, Venmo, Cash App) has yet to be widely adopted, as only half of consumers are projected to use P2P payments by the end of 2022.

However, the fact remains that most people carry their phone with them at all times, so digital payments present a natural opportunity to usher in the transition to cashless transactions. To harness this opportunity, digital wallets (e.g., Apple Pay, google Pay, samsung Pay) have been developed to facilitate payments using secure, contactless, near-field communication (nFC) technology. This technology allows for simply waving an nFC-enabled phone or watch in front of a reading device, with the payment billed to a linked credit or debit card. unlike a typical credit card transaction, nFC-enabled payments require the consumer to authorize the transaction using the built-in security features of their device, minimizing credit card fraud for consumers and businesses. Additionally, as adoption of P2P payment technology increases, transaction costs will decrease for merchants, encouraging further adoption of the payment technology.

approximately 15 percent of the population in the united states that are underbanked and, thus, must rely on cash. Further, critics cite the lack of accessibility for older generations as well as costs involved for the merchants and, last but not least, privacy concerns: unlike cash transactions, digital transactions are always stored somewhere, which may put people's privacy at risk when making   purchases or even donations. on the other hand, digital payments offer a host of opportunities for   retailers, enabling them to build ever closer relationships with their customers.

something using Bitcoin, the transaction is broadcast within the Bitcoin network, and is stored on a secure, public ledger that is accessible to any computer that wants to verify it. The authenticity of each transaction is ensured by digital signatures corresponding to the sending address of the payer and payee, and encryption ensures that the data about the parties involved in the transactions remains anonymous. The public ledger is constantly verified and maintained by the Bitcoin network and is thus 'open for business' 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is not subject to any national holidays. In the Bitcoin network, this public ledger takes the form of a blockchain -an indelible, decentralized public ledger to which transactions are added in blocks, serving as proof of all transactions ever made (  Figure   4.  18  ). As the ledger is decentralized (i.e., distributed over a large number of computers), any changes made require consensus by the majority of nodes, making the blockchain highly resilient against tampering, and entries, once made, cannot be deleted. While blockchain technology is most widely known as the technology underlying Bitcoin, organizations from IBM to Wells Fargo are exploring possible ways of using blockchain technology for any other types of transactions that require trust, accountability, and transparency (see   Chapter   8 for our discussion on the potential of using blockchain technology in managing supply chains)  .

MANAGING RISK IN B2C TRANSACTIONS. When making an online purchase using a credit or debit card, an online customer must transmit much personal information to a (sometimes unknown) merchant, and many internet users (sometimes rightfully) fear being defrauded by an

untrustworthy seller or falling victim to some other form of computer crime (see Table 4.4 for guidelines on how to conduct safe transactions on the internet; see also Chapter 10). For online merchants, the risk of people using fraudulent credit card data may be equally high. As in offline transactions, online consumers at times dispute transactions for various reasons. In such cases, the merchant is financially responsible for the transactions, and credit card issuers typically charge back transactions that are disputed by cardholders. For the merchants, such chargebacks normally result in the loss of the transaction amount, loss of the merchandise, processing costs, and chargeback fees; in addition, the merchant's bank may charge higher fees or even close the merchant account if the chargeback rate is excessively high. Thus, minimizing chargebacks is of prime concern for online merchants. Some of the reasons for chargebacks, such as unclear store policies, product descriptions, shipping terms, or transaction currencies, can be minimized through good web store design; other reasons, such as stolen credit cards, require different safeguards (Visa, 2008).

Any credit card transactions must be authorized by the issuer of the credit card (typically the bank). However, this authorization merely ensures that the credit card was not reported as lost or stolen but does not ensure that the person making the transaction is the actual cardholder. In such card-not-present transactions, there is no imprint of the physical card and no cardholder signature, so online merchants must be especially careful when deciding whether to make a transaction. While online customers demand a quick checkout process, leaving the merchant with little time to authenticate whether the customer is indeed the cardholder, the transaction date is the date the merchandise is shipped; thus, online merchants typically have one or several days to verify the identity of the cardholder (except for digital products or services). One mechanism used to authorize card-not-present transactions is the so-called card security code ,

a three-digit code located on the back of the card; this code is not stored in the card's magnetic stripe and is thus only known to a person who is in the possession of the physical card (note that credit card company rules prohibit merchants from storing the code). To further minimize risk, online merchants often use automated fraud-screening services that provide the merchants with a risk score based on a number of variables such as match between shipping address, billing address, and phone number; the time of the order and the customer's time zone; transaction volume; and the customer's IP address and its geographic location. Based on the risk score, merchants can then decide whether to let the transaction go through. For such screening services to be most effective, the merchant should collect as much data as possible during the checkout process, which may lead some customers to abandon their shopping carts. In addition, online merchants can assess orders based on various fraud indicators (Figure 4.19); Visa recommends looking for fraud indicators such as:

- ■ Email addresses. Legitimate email addresses often contain some parts of the customer's name; in contrast, fraudsters often set up email addresses consisting of meaningless character combinations with free email providers.
- ■ Shipping and billing addresses. Fraudsters often have the merchandise shipped to foreign, high-risk countries. Thus, merchants may require billing and shipping addresses to be the same. In addition, as many fraudsters come from foreign countries, misspellings of common words or street names may serve as a potential fraud indicator.
- ■ Transaction patterns. Fraudulent transactions often show very distinct patterns. For example, the orders may be larger than normal, may consist of multiple items of the same type, or may consist largely of big-ticket items. Similarly, fraudulent transactions often consist of multiple orders using the same credit card in a short period or multiple orders using different cards shipped to the same address. Further, fraudsters often use overnight shipping to reduce the merchant's time for verification checks and to be able to quickly resell the merchandise.

Being alert for such fraud indicators can help an online merchant to reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions. Often, it is prudent to either call the customer for verification of the order (though this may be problematic for privacy reasons) or outright reject the transaction.

## Legal Issues in EC

Although EC is now a viable and well-established business practice, there are issues that have changed the landscape for businesses and consumers and continue to do so. Two of the most important issues for EC businesses are taxation of online purchases and the protection of intellectual property, especially as it pertains to digital products, both of which are outlined next.

TAXATION. Although this issue is a relatively old one, it remains controversial within the American legal system. With EC global transactions increasing at an exponential rate, many governments are concerned that sales made via electronic sales channels must be taxed to make up for the lost revenue in traditional sales methods. As people shop less in local retail stores, many cities, states, and even countries are now seeing a decrease in their sales tax income because of EC. Table 4.5 highlights issues associated with taxation of EC transactions.

According to tax laws such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act , sales on the internet are treated the same way as mail-order sales, and a company is required to collect sales tax only from customers residing in a state where the business had substantial presence. In other words, only if an EC business had office facilities or a shipping warehouse in a certain state (say,   California) would it have to collect sales tax on sales to customers from that state (in that case, California). Many EC businesses thus strategically selected their home bases to offer 'taxfree shopping' to most customers. For example, Amazon tended to be very selective in where it located shipping facilities and warehouses to offer favorable tax conditions for most customers while still being able to offer fast delivery. Walmart.com, on the other hand, collects taxes on all U.S. EC transactions, as it is physically present in every U.S. state. Note that even if the EC business does not collect sales tax on goods or services you may have purchased, you are still liable

| Increases tax income of local, state, and federal governments Removes unfair advantage for e-tailers over brick-and-mortar stores Increases accountability for e-tailers | Slows EC growth and opportunity Creates additional compliance burden for e-tailers E-tailers located in one state would subsidize other states or jurisdictions Drives EC businesses to other countries |

for paying 'use tax' (usually equal to your state's sales tax) on those goods and services. Currently, Amazon has negotiated tax agreements with various states, and the U.S. legislature has proposed the Marketplace Fairness Act to simplify taxation issues surrounding e-commerce and to allow states to require e-tailers to collect sales tax even if the e-tailer has no physical presence. No matter whether (or when) this act is passed, taxation will remain a difficult issue.

On an international level, taxation is even more difficult. A U.S. customer ordering an item from China may be liable for paying use tax in his or her home state; likewise, a customer outside the United States ordering from a U.S. seller would not have to pay U.S. sales tax but may be liable for paying tax (and/or import duty) in his or her home country on the shipment's arrival. For digital products (such as software or music downloads), the movement of the product is difficult to track, and the tax revenue is easily lost. Obviously, e-businesses actively doing business in other countries have to comply with the various tax laws in different countries.

OTHER LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS. In addition to taxation, companies selling goods or services on the web face a myriad of other issues. For example, companies should ensure they have explicit, enforceable terms of contract, terms of sale, and/or terms of website use; such terms may also cover questions surrounding the liability for content and its accuracy. Further, ownership of content and trademarks can be a virtual minefield. When posting content on one's site, one must ensure not to infringe on others' copyrights or trademarks (e.g., by posting product photographs without permission or even by having trademarked names in one's domain name). Likewise, care must be taken if third parties develop content for one's site: Who will own the copyright for that material? However, online businesses should not only ensure not to infringe on others' intellectual property but also make sure to protect their own intellectual property, such as by displaying copyright notices and the like. Finally, it is important to clearly state the jurisdiction and ensure to comply with the laws and regulations of that jurisdiction.

DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT. With consumers increasingly using EC as a viable alternative to traditional commerce, the entertainment industry has no choice but to embrace the internet as a distribution medium. Yet digital media are easily copied and shared by many people, as the entertainment industry has painfully learned after the introduction of the compact disc. Hence, the entertainment industry has turned to digital rights management (DRM) , which is a technological solution that allows publishers to control their digital media (music, movies, and so on) to discourage, limit, or prevent illegal copying and distribution. DRM restrictions include which devices will play the media, how many devices the media will play on, and even how many times the media can be played.

To prevent illegal sharing of DRM-free content, it is often watermarked so that any illegal copy can be traced to the original purchaser (e.g., content purchased on iTunes contains the email address used for the purchase) (Figure 4.20). A digital watermark is an electronic version of physical watermarks placed on paper currency to prevent counterfeiting.

The entertainment industry argues that DRM allows copyright holders to minimize sales losses by preventing unauthorized duplication, but critics refer to DRM as 'digital restriction management,' stating that publishers are arbitrary on how they enforce DRM. Further, critics argue that DRM enables publishers to infringe on existing consumer rights and to stifle innovation; for example, restrictions and limitations such as limiting the number of times a game can be activated or limiting on which devices media can be accessed cause much inconvenience to users (such as when purchasing a new computer) and can thus breed piracy. Finally, critics argue that examples such as Amazon or Apple's iTunes show that businesses can be very successful with DRM-free content (CNet Australia, 2012).

NET NEUTRALITY. The internet was designed as an open network, which means that every website, every application, and every type of data (e.g., a game, Skype call, or YouTube video) is treated the same. Because of this openness, virtually anyone or any business, well known or unknown, can access and be found on the web. For example, unknown bloggers can compete with large news providers like CNN for readers. Many believe that this openness has been the primary catalyst for countless innovations and some of today's most successful companies, like eBay and Google. Without this openness, many fear that startups and entrepreneurs will be muscled out of the marketplace by big corporations that have the money to control what people are able to see or do on the web.

In general, net neutrality is the principle that all internet data should be treated the same. Proponents of net neutrality believe that the internet should forward all data packets on a firstcome, first-served basis, allowing anyone to freely communicate with any application or content without interference from a third party. Proponents are worried that without strong laws to protect the internet, governments, providers, and large corporations will be able to block internet applications and content and even block out competitors.

Many large corporations and telecommunications providers, however, would like to change the way information is accessed and prioritized on the web. Large telecommunication providers would like to charge different rates to access different websites, to have adequate speed to run certain applications, or even to have permission to plug in certain types of devices. Yet this would give larger and more established companies tremendous power over smaller and startup firms, and without legal protection, consumers could find that a network operator has blocked the website of a competitor or slowed the delivery of content from companies unwilling to pay additional fees.

Many believe that retaining net neutrality is critical to preserve current freedoms. It guarantees a level playing field for all websites and internet technologies. Without net neutrality, many of the next generation of innovations may be shut out.

While electronic commerce has now existed for several decades, it continues to evolve and mature. Each year, innovative strategies continue to emerge in virtually all sectors of business and government. Technologies evolve as well as how and where people conduct electronic commerce, from desktops, to laptops, to tablets, and to smartphones at home and while on the road. New capabilities often create unforeseen issues that require new laws and regulations. The best prediction about the future is that change will continue in this rapidly evolving space.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Retailing

You may make many purchases online to benefit from greater convenience or lower prices, but you will likely set foot in a brick-and-mortar retail store at least occasionally, and you may have noticed some changes brought by technology. A few decades ago, large retail chains started introducing computerized point-of-sale inventory systems consisting of checkout computers and an inventory control system. A simple bar code scan captures a sale, and the item is automatically deducted from the store's inventory, allowing real-time tracking of purchases so that the retailer knows when to reorder merchandise or restock shelves. in addition to a speedier checkout process, such systems help to reduce stockouts, increasing customer satisfaction. in many grocery stores, this system has been taken a step further, allowing the customers to conduct the checkout process themselves, saving time and labor costs. in switzerland, grocery retailer migros introduced a system that allows customers to scan items as they are placed into the shopping cart. At the checkout counter, all the customer must do is use a credit card.

in the near future, many items may be equipped with radio frequency identification (RFiD) tags   (see   Chapter   8  )  , eliminating the need to scan each individual item, so that the total price for a cart full of merchandise can be calculated within a second, saving even more time and adding convenience for the customer. imagine the time you'll save when all you have to do is pass with your cart through an RFiD reader and swipe or tap your credit card. Amazon's Amazon go stores have taken this concept even further, using technologies such as radar and computer vision to detect if a customer takes an item off the shelf, eliminating the need for even using RFiD tags. All a customer has to do is tap a credit card to enter the store; once they've finished shopping, the customer can just leave the store and continue with life.

Payment systems are also rapidly changing, driven partially by the adoption of more secure multi-factor authorization payments (e.g., your card, phone, code, signature, fingerprint, or face), 'chip' technology, and touchless payment systems. nFC-based payments have become widely implemented with mobile phones and use a technology called near-field communication (nFC-similar to bluetooth). The customer's mobile phone communicates with the retailer's payment terminal, and the payment amount is automatically charged to the stored payment method of choice (e.g., bank account, debit card, credit card). All major smartphone manufacturers such as Apple, google, lg, motorola, and samsung actively support this new technology by integrating the appropriate hardware into new handsets and by including mobile payment software.

Further, many brick-and-mortar retailers have had to respond to the phenomenon of showrooming, in which, as discussed earlier, customers examine products in person at a store and then leave to order the same product online for less. Retailers invest billions to build and maintain their storefronts, and online retailers can often undercut physical stores' prices; when a customer takes advantage of this, the brickand-mortar retailer cannot recoup the cost of the storefront. some retailers like best buy and Target are embracing this trend, however, by encouraging consumers to browse their shelves and compare prices online. by providing perks such as superior, personal customer service and instituting pricematching policies, these retailers prevent loss of customers due to price while benefiting by selling additional products. other new and exciting in-store technologies include smart fitting rooms that use augmented reality technology to show how an item would look when worn or suggest complementary items. Finally, retail stores are increasingly using bluetooth-enabled sales beacons to provide customers with real-time promotional offers.

As you can see, information systems have had a huge impact on retailing, and many more changes are yet to hit the shelves.

## Questions

1. How can technology help brick-and-mortar retailers compete against e-tailers?
2. Privacy advocates criticize the use of RFiD, as it allows better tracking of purchasing habits. How can brick-andmortar retailers alleviate these concerns?
3. As you have read, part of the 'human element' in retailing is being replaced by technology. How can brick-andmortar stores avoid becoming too 'sterile' when using information systems to compete against e-tailers?

## Key Points Review

1. Describe different approaches to competing in cyberspace as well as different forms of electronic government and fintech. EC is the online exchange of goods, services, and money between firms and between firms and their customers. Companies and individuals are engaging in business-to-business, business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, or consumer-to-business e-commerce. In addition, e-government is a government's use of IS to provide a variety of services to citizens (government-to-citizens), businesses (government-to-business), and other governmental agencies (either within a country or between countries, government-to-government). The internet has also enabled conducting financial transactions via online banking or online brokerage and has provided the basis for various innovative fintech services.
2. Describe business-to-consumer electronic commerce strategies. Companies must strategically position themselves to compete in the EC environment and choose between operating as brick-and-mortar companies, click-and-mortar (or bricks-and-clicks) companies, or click-only (or virtual) companies. Capabilities of the web have enabled new business models based on mass customization, disintermediation, or group buying as well as social commerce. E-tailers can benefit from being able to offer a wider variety of goods to more people at lower prices. On the other hand, a major drawback is customers' lack of trust.
3. Understand the keys to successful electronic commerce websites and explain the different forms of internet marketing. Successful B2C companies have a website that meets online customers' needs. A company should also advertise its web presence. Popular ways to advertise products or services on the web are search marketing, display ads, email marketing, social media, and mobile marketing. Advertisers pay for search marketing or display ads on the basis of either the number of impressions or payper-click. Various metrics and web analytics can
4. provide valuable information about the effectiveness of internet marketing campaigns and performance of websites.
4. Describe mobile commerce, voice commerce, consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce, and consumer-to-business electronic commerce. M-commerce is rapidly expanding with the continued evolution of faster cellular networks, more powerful handheld devices, and more sophisticated applications. Location-based services, based on GPS technology, are a key driver, enabling even more innovative m-commerce applications. As mobile consumers not only use their devices to obtain timely information on the go but also increasingly purchase products or content in mobile settings, businesses have to consider the specific settings and devices of their target customers. With the rise of smart voice assistants, voice commerce has become the new battleground for market dominance in e-commerce. Further, the internet has fueled the development of a variety of ways people can trade goods, socialize, or voice their thoughts and opinions. Specifically, e-auctions allow private people to sell goods to large markets. One emerging topic in EC is C2B EC, where individuals offer products or services to businesses.
5. Describe how to conduct financial transactions and navigate the legal issues of electronic commerce. The ability to pay for products or services is key for any form of electronic commerce. Yet securing payments in the digital world is still of concern, both for customers and for merchants, who have to minimize their risk arising from potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. As a result, many (especially smaller) retailers use online payment services; for some applications, cryptocurrencies have become an alternative form of payment. Finally, taxation; legal issues surrounding website content, contracts, and transactions; protecting intellectual property; and net neutrality continue to be major issues and impediments to EC.

## Spreadsheet Application: Analyzing Server Traffic

<!-- image -->

4-  34.

Campus Travel has recently found that its internet connections between offices are becoming slow, especially during certain periods of the day. Since all the online traffic is maintained by another company, an increase in bandwidth requires a formal approval from the general manager. The IS manager has proposed to increase the bandwidth of the company's network; in a few days, he must present the business case for this proposal at the weekly meeting of the department heads. You are asked to prepare graphs for the presentation to support the IS manager's business case. In the file ServerLogs.csv, you will find information about the network traffic for a 1-week period. Prepare the following graphs:

- ■ Total bandwidth used for each day (line graph)
- ■ Bandwidth used per day, by time period (line graph)
- ■ Average bandwidth used in each two-hour period (line graph)

Format the graphs in a professional manner and place each graph on a separate page. (Hint: If you are using Microsoft Excel's Chart Wizard, select 'Place chart: As New Sheet.')

## Database Application: Tracking Network Hardware

As Campus Travel is new to EC, the management suggests following a stepwise approach for using the internet to conduct business. Before using the internet for conducting transactions, the managers recommend setting up a site that provides information to customers. Part of this informational site is an agency locator that shows the services each agency has. You have been asked to create a new database. This includes creating relationships between entities. To create this new database, do the following:

- ■ Create a database called 'agency.'
- ■ Create a table called 'agencies' and include fields for agency ID, street address, city, state, ZIP code, phone number, number of service agents, and working hours.
- ■ Create a table called 'services' that includes service ID, name (i.e., type of service), and description.
- ■ Create a third table called 'agency\_services' that includes the agency ID field from the agencies table and the service ID field from the services table.
- ■ Once these tables are created, go to the relationship view and connect the agencies (one side) and agency\_services (many side) tables and the services (one side) and agency\_services (many side) tables using two one-to-many relationships (i.e., each agency can offer many services; each service can be offered by many agencies).

## Online Retailing

Online retailing is growing rapidly and is changing our everyday life as more and more people turn to shopping from their home  desktops,  laptops,  and  smartphones  at  the  comfort  of their homes, offices, or on the go. Online retailing is becoming very attractive to consumers for a wide selection of products and services. Traditional retailers are trying to catch up with the new advances in e-commerce, and most of them have their version of online stores in addition to their existing physical stores.  In  2020,  worldwide  retail  e-commerce  sales  reached $4.28 trillion and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to $5.4 trillion in 2022. This includes sales from e-commerce retailers as well as transactions that are conducted over consumerto-consumer shopping platforms such as online bidding and auction websites. The five largest online retailers in the world based on total sales are Alibaba, Amazon, Walmart, Apple, and Staples. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping has sky-rocketed and this trend is projected to continue into the future.  Though  store-based  retailers  will  exist  in  the  future, their sales are not likely to be able to match that of online retail.

## Questions and Exercises

## CASE 1 Web Analytics

In the 1990s, Josh James enrolled in an information systems class as part of his business management and entrepreneurship degree program. Being not particularly excited about the topic, Josh sat near the back of the room. During the first class period, Josh noticed a student near the front of the class who was easily answering all of the questions, and he decided he wanted to get to know him. His name was John Pestana, and they quickly became friends. John-a technology whiz with a knack for spinning web code-suggested that he and Josh start building websites for companies, and  a  partnership  was  born.  As  their student-run business grew amid the dotcom craze of the late 1990s, their clients began to ask about whether their fancy new websites were drawing any more web traffic. The two young entrepreneurs immediately recognized a compelling business opportunity, and they soon founded Omniture, a web analytics company that quickly grew to dominate the web analytics market. With innovative analytics tools, Omniture attracted many large companies, including Walmart, Comcast, NBC Universal, and Hyatt. In 2006, Omniture went public and was the number-two performing technology initial public offering (IPO) that year. Three years later, Omniture was acquired by technology giant Adobe Systems for US$1.8 billion. Adobe continues to develop the web analytics tools, which have since been integrated into the company's suite of online marketing solutions, the Adobe Marketing Cloud.

traffic data with the goal of understanding and optimizing web usage. The key features of most web analytics tools are enabled by a small bit  of  programming code that is embedded in each of the pages of a website. As a user navigates from page to page, various pieces of information about the user are collected. These include metadata such as the type of browser (Safari versus Chrome versus Edge), the type of device (mobile versus desktop), or the viewable resolution of the user's screen; browsing data such as how long the user stays on each page or where the user clicks; and navigation path data, such as which page the user came from or how many total pages the user has viewed within the website. The data are collected anonymously and aggregated for later  analysis.  For  popular  sites  like Walmart.com or Amazon, web analytics software can collect millions of points of data within a relatively short amount of time.

Web analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of web without completing their order when they are prompted to create a user account. This discovery could lead them to move the account creation process to a different point in the checkout flow or perhaps even make account creation optional. These are only a few of the nearly infinite potential discoveries  that  web  analytics  data  can  help discover.

Many companies employ entire teams whose sole purpose is to analyze web analytics data. These analytics data can be a gold mine of valuable information that a company can use to inform strategic decisions regarding its website. Consider the value of such information to a major online retailer like Zappos. Using analytics data, Zappos' analysts could study the browsing behaviors of thousands of different users to identify potential improvements to their website. They might find that users get stuck on a certain type of page and identify changes to the menu structure to improve the navigation. They may find that many users add items to their cart but exit the site

Given the large mass of web analytics data collected by a site like Walmart.com, there is a high potential for information overload. Thus, a key feature of successful web analytics solutions is the ability for business users to filter data in helpful ways, allowing them to drill down into items of interest. Another way in which analytics platforms reduce information overload is through the use of easy-to-interpret graphical representations of the data. These range from simple bar charts and line graphs to shaded geographical maps and complex charts depicting users' flow through a navigational structure. These and many other information summarization methods make the vast amount of web analytic data digestible  so  that  business  leaders  can  make informed, strategic decisions.

Web analytics is a prime example of business analytics in the digital age. For companies that conduct most of their business online, and in particular for retailers, entertainment hubs, and news providers, web analytics  data  provide  invaluable insight into the behavior of their customers. Those companies that learn to effectively leverage those data can make significant changes that directly affect their bottom line.

## CASE 2 Rocket Internet-Cloning Business Models

As many successful online businesses have painfully experienced, innovative business models in the digital world can be easily copied. Being early players in a new market and focusing on rapidly gaining market share, many companies enjoy a first-mover advantage but, due to their success, are cloned by numerous other 'impersonators' around the globe: The daily deal website Groupon has a variety of clones all over the world; Uber has been cloned in China but has also attracted me-too companies in various other countries; online clothing retailers such as Zappos or Asos have been cloned numerous times. Cloning successful business models can be less risky than coming up with and launching an innovative business idea, and often, developers of clones manage to sell the clones to the original companies later on; for example, in 2010, Groupon decided to buy up its 'clones' to reclaim its identity and, most important, fast-track its expansion into foreign markets in Europe and Asia.

Internet now operates in more than 110 countries, and Rocket Internet has built tremendous knowledge about which factors (e.g., cultural, geographic, legal, and so on) are important for what types of business models. Interestingly, while many of the business models copied by Rocket Internet were developed in the United States, none of Rocket Internet's clones operates in this market, which Rocket Internet considers oversaturated. Likewise, Rocket Internet has only limited reach in China, facing similar restrictions and protectionist policies as many other Western internet businesses.

Rocket Internet, one of Europe's biggest internet companies, has gained notoriety for cloning business models. Founded by the brothers Marc, Alexander, and Oliver Samwer, Rocket Internet's mission is 'to become the world's largest internet platform outside the United States and China.' To achieve this mission, Rocket Internet's focus is on building companies rather than innovating; in other words, Rocket Internet looks  for  innovative  and  successful internet-based business models and replicates those in other (often emerging or preemerging) markets, striving to grow the clone as quickly as possible with the aim of later selling the clone. To achieve rapid growth of a clone and gain a first-mover advantage in the clone's region, Rocket Internet attempts to increase the clone's reach, offers a wider variety of products or services, or tries to price competitors out of the market; typically, this approach requires investing significant funds not only into building the clone but also in marketing (using not only internet marketing, such as Google AdWords campaigns, but often also traditional television ads). Using this strategy has proven to be very successful; for example, CityDeal (a Groupon clone) was sold to Groupon for US$170 million less than 6 months after the clone was launched. Rocket Internet has successfully cloned a number of innovative online business models, ranging from Airbnb (Wimdu) to Uber (EasyTaxi) to GrubHub (foodpanda) to Zappos (Zalando, one of Europe's largest fashion retailers). Although Rocket Internet is  often  accused of 'stealing' business ideas, business models cannot be patented, and so there is little danger of facing legal consequences for infringing on other's intellectual property.

While cloning successful internetbased business models seems easy, this is not necessarily the case. Often, the originals are focused on growing their business in their respective home markets. Other markets, however, typically require different approaches to operations, marketing, and so on. Being extremely effective at adapting business models and tailoring them to local market conditions has been key to the success of Rocket Internet. This is even more astonishing given that Rocket

Despite its impressive growth, Rocket Internet is also facing challenges. Using proprietary technologies and processes, Rocket Internet tries to launch a business within less than 100 days, after which it decides whether to continue pursuing the business model. In this process, Rocket Internet learned that cloning business ideas that heavily rely on communities and the network effect (such as Airbnb) is infeasible within a short time frame, given the need for building a community and customer trust. Further, although many of Rocket Internet's businesses have achieved phenomenal growth, many have yet to make a  profit,  and  Rocket  Internet  has  been accused of not being transparent about the valuation of companies in its portfolio. However, as long as innovators continue to come up with new business ideas, there's a good chance of these ideas being cloned, be i t   by  Rocket  Internet  or  by  other companies.
