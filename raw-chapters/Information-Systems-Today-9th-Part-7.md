## Enhancing Business Processes Using Enterprise Information Systems

## Preview

This  chapter  describes  how  companies  are  deploying enterprise-wide information systems to support and enable core business processes. Enterprise systems help to integrate various business activities, to increase coordination among various business departments and partners, to streamline and better manage interactions with customers, and to coordinate better with suppliers to more efficiently and effectively meet rapidly changing customer demands.

Companies continue to find that they need systems that span their entire organization to tie everything together. As a result, an understanding of enterprise systems is needed to succeed in today's competitive and ever-changing  digital  world.  This  chapter  focuses  on how organizations are utilizing enterprise-wide information systems to best support internal business processes.  In  Chapter 8, 'Strengthening   Business-  to-Business Relationships Via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management,' we focus on systems that support business  processes  spanning  multiple  organizations, critical in today's competitive global environment.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Amazon

A mazon has transformed how we shop. Having started as an online bookseller, Amazon now retails nearly everything, from kitchen appliances to garden furniture and even groceries. Amazon strives to provide a superior product selection well beyond the biggest malls and big-box stores paired with the convenience of allowing customers to purchase the products with one click from their computers or mobile devices.

Founded and headed by Jeff Bezos, Amazon started in 1994 with a commitment to be 'customer-centric.'   Amazon custom  tailors  its  home  page  with  recommendations  for books, music, and other products that may entice you; these recommendations are provided by analyzing your prior purchases and comparing them to those of millions of other customers with similar tastes. Amazon offers free shipping for many of their products when you place orders over a minimum amount, and they also offer Prime ,  a  subscription  that  offers  free  expedited  shipping  and  other  perks such  as  video  and  music  streaming.  In  certain  cities  and depending on regional warehouse inventory, Amazon offers same-day delivery on items placed before a cutoff time. Amazon is working on a package delivery system that uses small, unmanned drones to deliver small packages within 30 minutes of placing the order.

To  keep  its  competitive  advantage,  Amazon  uses enterprise-wide  information  systems  to  optimize  its business processes, ranging from acquiring and receiving the right goods at the right time from its suppliers

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Explain core business processes that are common in organizations.
2.  Describe what enterprise systems are and how they have evolved.
3.  Describe enterprise resource planning systems and how they help to improve internal business processes.
4.  Understand and utilize the keys to successfully implementing enterprise systems.

to efficiently shipping physical goods to its customers. Amazon has built not only a network of dozens of North American and international fulfillment centers for its physical products but also a number of sophisticated data centers to support its operations and offer  various  digital  products  and  services.  Amazon even manages online stores and sales fulfillment for many small and large companies, creating a win-win situation: For small, independent retailers, warehousing  becomes  a  variable  cost,  and  for  Amazon,  this creates additional revenue streams and helps utilize excess capacity (Figure 7.1). Using its information systems (IS) infrastructure, Amazon offers Amazon Web Services (AWS), a solid and reliable IS infrastructure that allows companies to rent computing resources or storage space on an as-needed basis or even deploy enterprise resource planning systems in the cloud.

Clearly,  Amazon  is  more  than  a  vibrant  online store. Having designed an impressive IS infrastructure, Amazon is constantly developing new and innovative products and services that utilize this infrastructure. In 2019, with more than 2 billion active monthly customer visits,  Amazon  posted  net  sales  of  US$280  billion  (an increase of nearly US$50 billion over 2018), making it the leading online retailer in the United States. What the future holds for Amazon is inconceivable, given its current rate of innovation and growth.

A company's functional areas should be interrelated.

## Core Business Processes and Organizational Value Chains

Traditionally, companies are organized around five distinct functional areas: marketing and sales, supply  chain  management,  manufacturing  and  operations,  accounting  and  finance,  and  human resources. Each of these functional areas is responsible for various well-defined business functions, such as marketing a product; sales forecasting; procuring raw materials and components; manufacturing goods; planning and budgeting; or recruiting, hiring, and training. Although this model suggests that a company can be regarded as being composed of distinct independent silos, the different functional areas are highly interrelated to perform value-added activities (Figure 7.2). In fact, most business processes cross the boundaries of business functions, so it is helpful for managers to think in terms of business processes from a customer's (both internal and external) point of view.

## Core Business Processes

In most cases, customers do not care about how things are being done; they care only that things are being done to their satisfaction. When you buy a book at Amazon, you typically do not care which functional areas are involved in the transaction; you care only about quickly getting the right book for the right price. Buying a book at Amazon can help to illustrate one of the core business processes, namely, order-to-cash. Similarly, procure-to-pay and make-to-stock are core business processes also common to most business organizations. Other important business processes are related to tracking a firm's revenues and expenses, managing employees, and so on. Next, we discuss the core business processes involved in generating revenue.

ORDER-TO-CASH. For business organizations, selling products or services is the main way of generating revenue. In the example of Amazon, you need to create an account and add items to your shopping cart. You then need to complete your order by entering shipping and billing information and submitting the order. Amazon will then confirm that your address is valid and will check your credit card information. Your order will then be put together and shipped, and your credit card will be charged. Together, the processes associated with selling

a product or service are referred to as the order-to-cash process (Figure 7.3). As with all business processes, the order-to-cash process can be broken down into multiple subprocesses (most of which are common across organizations). For most businesses, the order-to-cash process entails subprocesses such as creating a customer record; checking the customer's creditworthiness; creating an order; checking and allocating stock; picking, packing, and shipping; invoicing; and collecting the payment. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the individual subprocesses and the time in which these are completed can differ considerably. For example, a sale in a convenience store may take only several seconds, and many of the subprocesses mentioned (such as creating a customer record) are not needed (although many stores now try to gather information such as customers' ZIP codes for business intelligence). In contrast, large volume orders in business-to-business contexts may take months or years to fulfill and may involve many more steps. The subprocesses can be further broken down to a more granular level.

Obviously, an ineffective order-to-cash process can have various negative effects for organizations; for example, the manual input of order information often causes errors, as do suboptimal picking and shipping processes. Together, such errors can lead to a high rate of disputes that must be resolved, ineffective collection processes, and, ultimately, defecting customers. In contrast, an effective order-to-cash process can create customer satisfaction, speed up the collection process, and serve to provide valuable inputs into business intelligence and customer relationship management applications (see Chapter 8).

PROCURE-TO-PAY. To be able to sell books and other products, Amazon needs to acquire these from its suppliers. Amazon needs to manage literally thousands of suppliers, place purchase orders, receive the products, allocate warehouse space, receive and pay invoices, and handle potential disputes. These processes associated with procuring goods from external vendors are together referred to as the procure-to-pay process (Figure 7.4). Subprocesses of the procureto-pay process include price and terms negotiations, issuing of the purchase order, receiving the goods, and receiving and paying the invoice.

An ineffective procure-to-pay process can increase error rates in purchase order and invoice processing; further, it inhibits a company from developing close relationships with preferred vendors. Together, this can increase the cost per transaction, lead to an increase in disputes to be resolved, and prevent the company from obtaining the most favorable conditions from its vendors. In contrast, an effective procure-to-pay process can help to obtain favorable conditions, reduce transaction costs, and, ultimately, create customer goodwill as it helps to efficiently fulfill customer orders.

MAKE-TO-STOCK/MAKE-TO-ORDER. A third set of core business processes is associated with producing goods (such as Amazon's Echo speaker) and entails make-to-stock and   maketo-order. In the make-to-stock process , goods are produced based on forecasts and are stocked in a warehouse (i.e., a push-based approach); customers' orders are then fulfilled from inventory. In contrast, in the make-to-order process , raw materials, subcomponents, and accessories are procured based on forecasts, but actual manufacturing does not start until an order is received (a pull-based approach); in extreme cases, even design and engineering start only when an order is received. For example, mass-produced goods, such as television sets or home appliances, are typically produced under a make-to-stock approach. Here, the organization stocks the produced goods, pushing the products out to customers after orders are received. In contrast, highly customizable or very expensive low-volume goods are often produced under a maketo-order approach, as is the case with Dell computers or with commercial aircraft, where the assembly starts only after a customer has placed an order (see Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems' for the concept of mass customization). Here, the organization waits for an order, allowing it to initiate a pulling sequence to move the order through the production process. The processes associated with making products are composed of processing customers' orders, procuring the inputs to the manufacturing process, scheduling production, production, quality control, packaging, and stocking or shipping the product. Figure 7.5 illustrates the make-to-stock and make-to-order processes.

Together, these core business processes enable the creation of supply chains that are involved in transforming raw materials into products sold to the end customer. A typical supply chain resembles a river, where the raw materials start out at the source and move downstream toward the end customer; at each step, the goods are transformed to make the end product. To meet the needs for various different inputs, each organization typically has multiple upstream suppliers; similarly, each organization typically sells to multiple downstream customers. Figure 7.6 shows the supply chain of a book. Within this supply chain, one company's salesrelated processes overlap with the downstream company's procurement-related processes (supply chains are discussed in detail in Chapter 8).

## Organizational Activities Along the Value Chain

To gain competitive advantage over their rivals, companies are trying to optimize the core business processes in different ways to increase effectiveness and/or efficiency. One of the first challenges an organization must face is to understand how it can use information systems to support core and other business processes. For example, Amazon excels at using information systems to optimize both the procure-to-pay and the order-to-cash process. Generally, the set of business activities that add value to the end product is referred to as a value chain (Porter &amp; Millar, 1985), in  which information flows through functional areas that facilitate an organization's business processes. Figure 7.7 depicts the value chain framework. In Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive

Advantage Through Information Systems,' we spoke of the strategic value of analyzing a value chain. Here, we show you how the activities along the value chain support business processes.

Many business processes depend on activities performed by various functional areas within an organization; for example, Amazon's order-to-cash process involves activities performed by sales, shipping, accounting, and other functional areas. The functional areas directly involved in the process are responsible for the core activities, whereas other functional areas are performing support activities. In other words, core activities are performed by the functional areas that process inputs and produce outputs, and support activities are those activities that enable core activities to take place. In the following sections, we focus on core activities and then turn our attention to the support activities that make them possible.

CORE ACTIVITIES. Core activities include inbound logistics (receiving), operations and manufacturing, outbound logistics (shipping), marketing and sales, and customer service. These activities may differ widely depending on the unique requirements of the industry in which a company operates, although the basic concepts hold in most organizations.

Value chain framework.

Inbound Logistics Activities Inbound logistics involves the business activities associated with receiving and stocking raw materials, parts, and products. For example, inbound logistics at Amazon involves not only the receipt of books, smart speakers, and various other products for sale but also the receipt of packaging materials and shipping labels. Shippers deliver these products to Amazon, where employees unwrap the packages and stock the products in the company's warehouse or directly route the products to operations to fill open orders. Amazon can automatically update inventory levels at the point of delivery, providing purchasing managers access to upto-date information related to inventory levels and reorder points. Inbound logistics activities (also referred to as supply chain management) are a crucial part of the procure-to-pay business process, as these activities enable the company to fill customer orders efficiently and effectively.

Operations and Manufacturing Activities Once the components have been stocked in inventory, operations and manufacturing activities transform the inputs into outputs. Operations and manufacturing can involve such activities as order processing (e.g., at Amazon) and/or manufacturing or assembly processes (e.g., at Dell) that transform raw materials and/or component parts into end products (i.e., the make-to-stock and make-to-order business processes). Companies such as Dell utilize web-based information systems to allow customers to enter orders online. This information is used to coordinate the manufacturing of a customized personal computer in which the component parts are gathered and assembled to create the end product. During this process, inventory levels from inbound logistics are verified; if the appropriate inventory exists, workers pick the components from existing supplies and build the product to the customer's specifications. When components are picked, items are deducted from inventory; once the product is assembled, inventory levels for the final product are updated.

Outbound Logistics Activities The activities associated with outbound logistics mirror those of inbound logistics. Instead of involving the receipt of raw materials, parts, and products, outbound logistics focuses on the distribution of end products within the order-to-cash business process. For example, outbound logistics at Amazon involves the shipping of books that customers have ordered. Orders that have been processed by operations are forwarded to outbound logistics, which picks the products from inventory and coordinates shipment to the customer. At that point, items are packaged and deducted from the company's inventory, and an invoice is created that will be sent to the customer. Amazon can automatically update sales data at the point of distribution, allowing managers to view inventory and revenue information in real time.

Marketing and Sales Activities Marketing and sales activities are associated primarily with the presales (i.e., before the sale) activities of the company. These activities include the creation of marketing literature, communication with potential and existing customers, and pricing of goods and services. Most companies support the business activity of marketing and sales by creating websites, building pages on Facebook, or communicating on other social media such as Twitter (for further discussion, see Chapter 4, 'Enabling Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce'). Many companies, especially those focused on selling products or services to the end consumer (e.g., passenger airlines such as United or online retailers such as Amazon), use information systems to update pricing information and/or schedules. This information is entered directly into the pricing and scheduling systems, allowing the information to become immediately accessible throughout the organization and to end consumers through the organization's website.

Customer Service Activities Whereas marketing and sales focus on presales activities, customer service focuses on post-sales (i.e., after the sale) activities. Customers may have questions and need help from a customer service representative. For most companies, such as Amazon, utilizing information systems to provide customer service is essential, especially given the vast number of products offered. These applications allow customers to search for and download information related to the products that they have purchased or the purchase itself. For example, on Amazon, customers can view their order status or can view and print invoices of current and past orders. Similarly, customers can find additional information and support about the Amazon Echo or other devices. Rather than calling a customer service representative, customers can easily find the needed information through a self-service customer support application. Information systems also enable customer service representatives to quickly locate information about products or services offered.

## GREEN IT

## Why Your Enterprise Systems Should Be in the Cloud

green IT refers to the practice of using computers and other IT resources in a more efficient and environmentally responsible way. A big part of the green IT movement has focused on cloud computing. Recall that cloud computing refers to a computing model that enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., servers, applications, etc.) that can be rapidly provisioned and released as needed with very little human intervention. Compared with traditional in-house architectures, cloud-based architectures are very efficient, allowing for the sharing of resources among multiple organizations in a much more efficient manner, and are therefore widely considered to be a much greener alternative than separate dedicated facilities for each company. one of the largest and most resource-consuming computer application for many companies is their enterprise-level systems. Thus, moving a company's enterprise systems into the cloud can provide many benefits.

cloud-based architecture include low capital outlays to get a system up and running, lower operating costs, better IT resource utilization, increased security, better ability to adjust to demand changes, and faster and more efficient deployment and upgrading. By going to the cloud, companies are often concerned with the reduced control over data and operations, but as cloud architectures continue to mature, such concerns are rapidly diminishing.

Increasingly, companies are moving their enterprise systems to the cloud, feeling that the benefits outweigh the risks. When moving to the cloud, it is critical that a strong and reliable cloud service provider be chosen. If a provider unexpectedly shuts down, the benefits of choosing the lowest-priced provider will quickly turn into an IT nightmare. Likewise, companies moving their enterprise systems to the cloud should consider the energy sources used by the cloud service provider.

one obvious benefit of moving an enterprise system onto a greener platform is that the organization will become known for sustainable business practices. Being known as a sustainable business can provide a competitive advantage in a world where a company's social responsibility (or lack thereof) can play a great role in its success (or failure). In addition to the marketing benefits, the economics of a cloudbased architecture can be compelling. Benefits of using a

Companies can also use information systems to track service requests. When a customer calls in for repairs to a product, customer service representatives can access a bevy of information related to the customer. For instance, an agent can access technical information concerning the specific product as well as review any problems the customer has encountered in the past. This enables customer service representatives to react quickly to customer concerns, improving the customer service experience.

SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. Support activities are business activities that enable the primary activities to take place. Support activities include administrative activities, infrastructure, human resources, technology development, and procurement.

Administrative Activities Administrative activities focus on the processes and decision making that orchestrate the day-to-day operations of an organization, particularly those processes that span organizational functions and levels. Administration includes systems and processes from virtually all functional areas-accounting, finance, marketing, operations, and so on-at all levels of an organization.

Infrastructure Activities Infrastructure refers to the buildings, machinery, and IS infrastructure components that must be implemented to provide the necessary components that facilitate both primary and support activities   (see   Chapter   3  , 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services')  . For example, an order entry application requires that employees who enter orders have a computer that is connected via the network to a database containing the order information so that the order can be saved and recalled later for processing.

Human Resource Activities Human resource activities encompass all business activities associated with employee management, such as hiring, interview scheduling, payroll, and benefits management. Human resource activities are classified as support activities because the primary activities cannot be accomplished without the employees to perform them. In other words, all the primary activities rely on human resource-related business activities.

Technology Development Activities Technology development includes the design and development of applications that support the primary business activities to improve products and/or services. If you are planning on pursuing a career in the management information systems (MIS) field, you will frequently participate in activities related to the development or acquisition of new applications and systems. Technology development can involve a wide array of responsibilities, such as the selection of packaged software or the design and development of custom software to meet a particular business need. Many companies are leveraging the technology development business activity to build internet, intranet, extranet, or mobile applications to support a wide variety of primary business activities. Likewise, technology development increasingly involves developing analytics solutions to support the transition to a data-driven organization.

Procurement Activities Procurement refers to the purchasing of goods and services that are required as inputs to the primary activities. Procurement receives, approves, and processes requests for goods and services from the primary activities and coordinates the purchase of those items. Allowing each functional area to send out purchase orders can create problems for companies, such as maintaining relationships with more suppliers than necessary and not being able to take advantage of volume discounts. The procurement business activity can leverage information systems by accumulating purchase orders from the different functional areas within the organization and combining multiple purchase orders containing the same item into a single purchase order. This facilitates negotiating volume discounts and allows the primary activities to concentrate on running the business rather than adding to their workload.

VALUE CHAIN ACTIVITIES IN SERVICE INDUSTRIES. Originally, the value chain framework was developed for analyzing the value-adding activities of manufacturing industries, but it can also be used to understand service-based industries. Many of the processes within service industries are similar to processes performed in manufacturing industries (e.g., customer service, sales, and support). However, whereas manufacturing industries deal with physical products, service industries deal with tangible and/or intangible products, which typically must be experienced and often cannot be tried out in advance. As a result, activities such as inbound logistics and outbound logistics are sometimes less important in the service sector, and many activities can occur simultaneously (e.g., both delivery and consumption). Likewise, in the manufacturing sector, operations include the physical handling of goods when transforming them from raw materials or components to finished products; in contrast, operations in the service sector often encompass the manipulation of data and information. For example, consider the value chain activities for booking and taking a commercial airline flight. Such activities would include booking the flight, checking in, in-flight experience, baggage handling, and so on. While service activities do not always perfectly map to Porter's value chain steps, there are clearly a set of integrated or related service-oriented activities that together provide value to a customer. Additionally, in many service encounters, each separate activity is essentially a value chain in and of itself. For instance, booking a flight is a series of steps, from advertising to obtaining a ticket, including flight selection, payment, confirmation, and various types of customer services that might include seat selection and other changes. In such service encounters, a finished product equates to a booked ticket, a closed file such as a bank loan that has been issued, an insurance claim that has been filed, or an investment that has been made. As a result, optimizing the value-adding activities in the services sector does not typically include eliminating physical bottlenecks or improving inventory management but enhancing the flow of information.

## Value Systems: Connecting Multiple Organizational Value Chains

The flow of information can be streamlined not only within a company but across organizational boundaries as well. A company can create additional value by integrating internal applications

Value System

## FIGURE 7.8

with suppliers, business partners, and customers. Companies accomplish this by connecting their internal value chains to form a value system (Porter &amp; Millar, 1985), in which information flows from one company's value chain to another company's value chain. Figure 7.8 depicts the value system framework. In this diagram, three companies are aligning their value chains to form a value system. First, Company A processes information through its value chain and forwards the information along to its customer, Company B, which processes the information through its value chain and sends the information along to its customer, Company C, which processes the information through its value chain. Adding additional suppliers, business partners, and customers can create  complex value systems. However, for our purposes, we simply view an organization's information systems as an important part of a value chain that interacts with the value chains of other organizations.

As information systems can be used to streamline an organization's internal value chain, they can also be used to coordinate a company's value chain with another company's value chain or with consumers (such as in business-to-consumer electronic commerce). Any information that feeds into a company's value chain, whether its source is another company's value chain or an end consumer, is considered part of the value system.

A supply chain can be viewed as a river, where physical goods 'flow' from a source to an ultimate destination. Like a river, at any point there is a flow coming from upstream and progressing downstream. In a similar way, a value system can be viewed as a river of information, comprising upstream and downstream information flows. An upstream information flow consists of information that is received from another organization, whereas a downstream information flow relates to the information that is produced by a company and sent along to another organization. For instance, in the value system depicted in Figure 7.8, the upstream and downstream information flows for Company B become quite evident. In this case, Company B receives information from its upstream supplier, processes the information through its internal value chain, and subsequently passes information downstream to its distributors and/or customers (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of product and information flows in the opposite direction). These flows of external information into and from a company can be leveraged to create additional value and gain competitive advantage.

## Enterprise Systems

Businesses have leveraged information systems to support business processes for decades, beginning with the installation of individual, separate applications to assist companies with specific business tasks, such as issuing paychecks. However, to efficiently and effectively conduct the core  business  processes  (as  well  as  other  business  processes),  the  different  functional  areas within a company need to share data. For example, data about your book order need to be shared between accounting (for billing purposes), marketing and sales (e.g., to feed into product recommendations for other customers), and operations and supply chain management (e.g., to fulfill the order and replenish the inventory).

FIGURE 7.9 Information flows using

standalone systems.

## The Rise of Enterprise Systems

As companies began to leverage IS applications, they typically started out by fulfilling the needs of  particular  business  activities  in  a  particular  department  within  the  organization,  and  purchased a variety of proprietary software systems from different software vendors or developed department-specific software (e.g., accounting) to support specific business processes. Systems that focus on the specific needs of individual departments are typically not designed to communicate with other systems in the organization (essentially, they are 'speaking different languages') and are therefore referred to as standalone applications .  Although such systems enable departments to conduct their daily business activities efficiently and effectively, these systems often are not very helpful when people from one part of the firm need information from another part of the firm. For example, if the applications for inbound logistics and operations are not integrated, companies will lose valuable time in accessing information related to inventory levels. When an order is placed through operations, personnel may have to access two separate applications to verify that the components are available in inventory before the order can be processed. Figure 7.9 provides an example of how information flows through standalone systems within an organization. As the diagram depicts, information is generated by the inbound logistics business activity, but it does not flow through to the next business activity, in this case operations; in other words, there are too many 'rocks' in the river, impeding the flow of information. Since the inbound logistics and operations departments use different standalone systems, information cannot readily flow from one business activity to another.

Understandably, this creates a highly inefficient process for operations personnel, who must have access to two systems or a common interface that pulls data together to get both the order entry and the inventory information. This can be challenging, as applications running on different computing platforms are difficult to integrate, and IS managers are faced with the problem of 'knitting together' a hodgepodge portfolio of discordant proprietary applications into a system that shares data; often, custom interfaces are required in order for one system to communicate with another, and such integration is typically very costly. In some cases, data may be stored on both systems, creating redundancy. Should data be updated in one system but not the other, the data become inconsistent. In addition, there are further unnecessary costs associated with entering, storing, and updating data redundantly. As a result, many standalone applications are typically either fast approaching or beyond the end of their useful life within the organization; such systems are referred to as legacy systems .

To utilize data stored in separate standalone systems to facilitate business processes and decision making, data must be reentered from one system to the next (by either manual typing, copying and pasting, or even downloads to Excel) or be consolidated by a third system. Further, the same data may also be stored in several (sometimes conflicting) versions throughout the organization, making the data harder to consolidate, often causing the business to lose money because of inefficiencies or missed business opportunities. In addition, organizations need integrated data to demonstrate compliance with standards, rules, or government regulations.

While having disparate systems is not without challenges, many organizations have been very successful in building their business using a best-of-breed approach (i.e., using a suite of independent systems that are the best systems within their respective areas). Using a bestof-breed approach allows organizations to maintain agility and quickly respond to changes in the business environment. An alternative approach is turning to enterprise-wide information systems. An enterprise-wide information system (or enterprise system ) is an integrated suite of business applications for virtually every business process, allowing companies to integrate data across functional areas on a company-wide basis. Rather than storing data in separate places throughout the organization, enterprise systems use an integrated database to provide a central repository common to all users. The central database alleviates the problems associated with multiple computing platforms by providing a single place where all data relevant to the company and particular departments can be stored and accessed. This, along with a common user interface, allows personnel to share information seamlessly, no matter where the user is located or who is using the application (Figure 7.10).

Enterprise systems come in a variety of shapes and sizes, each providing a unique set of features and functionality. When deciding to implement enterprise solutions, managers need to be aware of several issues. One of the most important involves selecting and implementing applications that meet the requirements of the business as well as of its customers and suppliers. In the following sections, we examine the ways in which information systems can be leveraged to support business processes and how companies are using these systems to support their internal and external operations.

## Supporting Business Processes

As discussed previously, information systems can be used to gain and sustain competitive advantage by supporting and/or streamlining activities along the value chain. For example, an information system could be used to support a billing process in such a way that it reduces the use of paper and, more important, the handling of paper, thus reducing material and labor costs. This system can help managers keep track of that same billing process more effectively because they will have more accurate, up-to-date information about the billing process, enabling them to make smart, timely business decisions.

Information systems can be used to support either internally or externally focused business processes. Internally focused systems support functional areas, business processes, and decision making within an organization. These activities can be viewed as a series of links in a chain along which information flows within the organization. At each stage (or link) in the

The 1993 cult classic film Demolition Man showed us that by 2032 every restaurant was a Taco Bell. The restaurant chain had defeated all others in the franchise wars, and it had become our 'everything' in dining options. Consolidation was not just limited to dining options, as audio and video technology was also used to surveil the citizens of (fictional) San Angeles, consolidating power, influence, and control by tracking people's every move and transgression. While there are certainly benefits of consolidation, there are also trade-offs in consumer choice, potential invasion of privacy, and the consequence of being on the wrong side of the consolidator.

In recent years, Amazon has strived to become a source of 'everything' for consumers. for example, not only does their platform consolidate buyers and sellers into a one-stop source for products, Amazon has moved far beyond the initial business model of selling books online. Household goods, consumer electronics, books, movies, music, reading devices, and even digital assistants are offered by the retailer. obviously, there are great benefits for consumers of their platform, such as increased convenience, the ability to purchase nearly any desired product from any device, and a seamless level of integration among products and services. Amazon also uses our shopping history, buying preferences, and other sources of data to help us find what we want, when we want it. In August 2020, Amazon announced a new wearable product, the Halo, which monitors and tracks our emotions, our activity levels, health, and even body composition. Although by design the data gathered from the Halo is separate from our consumer account, insurance companies have already started to think about how to harness this information, and with some companies having started to offer free Halos to their customers.

having violated Chinese censorship laws, for being connected with the 'wrong' people, or for entirely unknown reasons related to WeChat's internal algorithms. unfortunately for those consumers on the wrong side of WeChat and their consolidation of power within China, the inability to access 'everything' instead becomes synonymous with the ability to do nothing with potential devastating consequences for those locked out of their accounts.

## Questions

1. What are the ethical issues Amazon has to take into account when offering and doing 'everything', from online shopping to monitoring people's health and emotional states?
2. given the power of companies such as Amazon, in how far should legislation regulate the use and consolidation of people's data

Information begins to accumulate at the point of entry and flows through the various links, or business processes, within the organization, progressing through the organization with new, useful information being added every step of the way (Figure 7.11).

Companies can gain several advantages by integrating and converting legacy systems so that data stored on separate computing platforms can be consolidated to provide a centralized point of access. However, although internally focused systems do an excellent job of serving the needs of internal business operations on an organization-wide basis, they are not necessarily designed to completely accommodate the communication of information outside the organization's boundaries. The emergence of the internet and the web has resulted in the globalization of customer and supplier networks, opening up new opportunities and methods

to conduct business. For example, raw materials and component parts for a computer may come from China and be shipped to Europe for fabrication, and the final products are assembled and shipped to customers across the globe (see Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World'). Customers have an increasing number of options available to them, so they are demanding more sophisticated products that are customized to their unique needs. They also expect higher levels of customer service. If companies cannot keep their customers satisfied, the customers will not hesitate to do business with a competitor. Therefore, companies need to provide quality customer service and develop products faster and more efficiently to compete in global markets.

To this end, externally focused systems help to streamline communications and coordinate business processes with customers, suppliers, business partners, and others who operate outside an organization's boundaries. A system that communicates across organizational boundaries is sometimes referred to as an interorganizational system . The key purpose of an interorganizational system is to streamline the flow of information from one company's operations to another's (e.g., from a company to its potential or existing customers).

Competitive advantage can be achieved here by integrating multiple business processes in ways that enable a firm to meet a wide range of unique customer needs. Sharing information between organizations helps companies to adapt more quickly to changing market conditions. For instance, should consumers demand that an additional component be added to a product, a company can gain this information from its information systems that support sales and instantaneously pass it along to its component suppliers. Information systems allow the company and its suppliers to satisfy the needs of customers efficiently because changes can be identified and managed immediately, creating a competitive advantage for companies that can respond quickly. In addition, streamlining the information flows can help companies find innovative ways to increase accurate on-time shipments, avoid (or at least anticipate) surprises (such as shortages in raw materials or weather problems), minimize costs, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction and the overall profitability of the company. We can view processes and information flows across organizations just as we previously viewed the processes and information flows within an organization. At each stage (or link) in the process, value is added by the work performed, and new, useful information is generated and exchanged between organizations (Figure 7.12). Using an interorganizational system, one company can create information and transmit it electronically to another company.

Systems that facilitate interorganizational communications focus on the upstream and downstream information flows. On the upstream side, supply chain management applications integrate the value chains of business partners within a supply chain, improving the coordination of suppliers, product or service production, and distribution. On the downstream side, customer relationship management applications concentrate on the activities involved in promoting and selling products to the customers as well as providing customer service and nourishing longterm relationships (both types of applications are discussed in Chapter 8). Integrating internally focused and externally focused applications can be extremely valuable for companies operating in global markets.

IMPROVING BUSINESS PROCESSES THROUGH ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS. Software programs come in two forms-packaged and custom. Packaged software , sometimes referred to as offthe-shelf software , is written by third-party vendors for the needs of many different users and organizations, supporting standardized, repetitive tasks, such as word processing, payroll processing, or preparing taxes. These programs can be quite cost effective because the vendor that builds the application can spread out development costs through selling to many different users.

Yet packaged software may not be well suited for tasks that are unique to a particular business. In these cases, companies may prefer to develop (or have developed for them) custom software , which is designed and developed exclusively for specific organizations (see Chapter 9, 'Developing and Acquiring Information Systems') and can accommodate their particular business needs. However, obtaining custom software is much more expensive because the organization must bear all costs (in terms of time, money, and other resources) associated with designing and developing the software. Furthermore, applications need to be maintained internally when changes are required. With packaged software, the vendor makes the changes and distributes new versions to its customers. In all, there are trade-offs when choosing between the packaged and custom software routes. Managers must consider whether packaged software can meet the business requirements and, if not, conduct a cost-benefit analysis to ensure that taking the custom software approach will prove worthwhile to the company.

Because no two companies are alike, no packaged software application will exactly fit the unique requirements of every business. Thus, enterprise systems are designed around modules , which are components that can be selected and implemented as needed. In essence, each module is designed to replace a legacy system, be it a finance, human resources, or manufacturing system; after the conversion to an enterprise system, each business function has access to various modules that serve its needs, but the modules (and the underlying data) are tightly integrated and share the same look and feel (Figure 7.13).

Vanilla Versus Customized Software The features and modules that an enterprise system comes with out of the box are referred to as the vanilla version . If the vanilla version does not support a certain business process, the company may require a customized version. Customization provides either additional software that is integrated with the enterprise system or consists of direct changes to the vanilla application itself. Most enterprise systems include literally thousands of elements that can be customized. Companies must take special care when dealing with customization, as customization can be extremely costly, and maintaining and upgrading customizations can be troublesome. For example, a customization made to the vanilla version will need to be reprogrammed when a new release of the system is implemented because subsequent releases of the software will not include the previous customizations. In other words, new vanilla versions must be continually upgraded to accommodate the company-specific

customizations. This process can involve a substantial investment of time and resources, diverting attention away from other key business activities and reducing company profits.

Best Practices-Based Software One of the major hurdles facing companies that implement enterprise systems involves changing business processes to accommodate the manner in which the software works. Enterprise system implementations are often used as a catalyst for overall optimization of underlying business processes. As a result, most enterprise systems are designed

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## The Internet of Things Will Transform ERP and Organizations

The Internet of Things (IoT), which refers to a broad range of physical objects (such as computers, sensors, or motors) that are interconnected and automatically share data over the internet, has seen rapid developments. Many think that the IoT is primarily about your toaster talking to your refrigerator. While this may or may not occur, there are many other applications of IoT, particularly when creating products and services, where IoT technologies can be transformative.

intervention. finally, things never get tired or run out of things to say. Such things, and their sensors, will silently and diligently do their job sending updates as often as needed.

Early enterprise software focused on people; systems were designed to help people complete activities such as paying a bill, ordering a part, or paying an employee. The systems interacted with people. People provided data, people started processes, or people paid a bill. While all these activities are needed and useful, the integration of 'things' will significantly transform the way organizations do business. for example, there are many more things than people. When virtually every product, every assembly, and every machine is connected to the enterprise system, there is a lot more data available to understand what is happening. With such data, many operations can happen automatically without human intervention. Also, things can tell you more than people. Complex machines can have dozens of sensors that provide much more data than could ever be generated by a single machine operator. And these data can be collected continuously (e.g., every millisecond if necessary) and, again, without human

When IoT technologies provide data for enterprise-wide systems, the enterprise will have a better understanding of virtually every aspect of the business, and at a depth and precision never before possible. With such business intelligence, organizations not only will operate more efficiently and effectively, they also will learn much more about their business processes, such as where improvements can be made and what tasks are most vulnerable to disruption. Such insights will result in process improvements and better products and could generate more than uS$11 trillion a year in value by 2025, according to McKinsey. over time, IoT technologies will help companies rapidly and iteratively improve how their business is performed.

The basic steps of BPM include developing a vision, identifying the critical processes that are to be redesigned, understanding and measuring the existing processes, identifying ways that information systems can be used to improve processes, and designing and implementing the new processes.

to operate according to industry-standard business processes, or best practices , and vendors offer many industry-specific versions that have already been customized for particular industries based on best practices and the data types and requirements of the specific industries. Best practices reflect the techniques and processes, identified through experience and research, that have consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means. In fact, because they have proven to consistently lead to superior performance, most enterprise system vendors build best practices into their applications to provide guidelines for management to identify business activities within their organizations that need to be streamlined. Implementations and future upgrades to the system will go more smoothly when companies change their business processes to fit the way the enterprise system operates, and companies that reject these best practices are in for a long and time-consuming implementation (although the vendors and external consultants typically offer help in the process).

However, many organizations have spent years developing business processes that provide them with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Adopting their industry's best practices may force these companies to abandon their unique ways of doing business, putting them on par with their industry competitors. In other words, companies can potentially lose their competitive advantages by adopting the best practices within their industry. Given the importance and difficulty of changing business processes with enterprise and other systems implementations, we now briefly describe business process management.

Business Process Management Optimizing business processes is key for organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and agility, and over the years, various approaches for improving business processes have been developed. Given the magnitude of change that an enterprise system can impose on an organization's business processes, understanding the role of business process management in the implementation of an enterprise system is necessary. Business process management (BPM) is a systematic, structured improvement approach by all or part of an organization whereby people critically examine, rethink, and redesign business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in one or more performance measures, such as quality, cycle time, or cost.

BPM, which became very popular in the 1990s (and was then called business process reengineering [BPR] ), is based on the notion that radical redesign of an organization is sometimes necessary to lower costs and increase quality and that information systems are the key enabler for that radical change. The basic steps in BPM can be summarized as follows (  Figure   7.  14  ):

1. Develop a vision for the organization that specifies business objectives, such as reducing costs, shortening the time it takes to get products to market, improving quality of products and/or services, and so on.

<!-- image -->

2. Identify the critical processes that are to be redesigned.
3. Understand and measure the existing processes as a baseline for future improvements.
4. Identify ways that information systems can be used to improve processes.
5. Design and implement a prototype of the new processes.

At the heart of BPM initiatives are information systems that enable the streamlining of business processes. Given the importance of information systems in such endeavors, organizations are increasingly hiring IS consultants and business analysts who have a sound understanding of the business but who are also well versed in technology. In fact, business analysts and systems analysts are often listed among the hottest jobs because of good job prospects, high salaries, and the diversity of work. In enterprise systems projects, business analysts are deeply involved in analyzing and improving business processes and mapping the processes to the different enterprise systems modules.

BPM is similar to quality improvement approaches such as total quality management and continuous process improvement in that they are intended to be cross-functional approaches to improve an organization. BPM differs from these quality improvement approaches, however, in one fundamental way. These quality improvement approaches tend to focus on incremental change and gradual improvement of processes, while the intention behind BPM is radical redesign and drastic improvement of processes.

When BPR was introduced in the 1990s, many efforts were reported to have failed. These failures occurred for a variety of reasons, including the lack of sustained management commitment and leadership, unrealistic scope and expectations, and resistance to change. In fact, BPR gained the reputation of being a nice way of saying 'downsizing.'

Nevertheless, BPR (and its successors such as BPM) lives on today and is still a popular approach to improving organizations. No matter what it is called, the conditions that appear to lead to a successful business process improvement effort include the following:

- ■ Support by senior management
- ■ Shared vision by all organizational members
- ■ Realistic expectations
- ■ Participants empowered to make changes
- ■ The right people participating
- ■ Sound management practices
- ■ Appropriate funding

In any event, successful business process change, especially involving enterprise systems, requires a broad range of organizational factors to converge that are far beyond the technical implementation issues.

Benefits and Costs of Enterprise Systems Beyond the improvements in critical business processes, there are various types of benefits and costs associated with the acquisition and development of enterprise systems. According to industry research, project performance has improved, with over 60 percent of project completed within (or even under) budget, but those projects that did exceed budgets did so on average by more than 65 percent; likewise, only slightly more than half of the projects finished within the projected time (Panorama, 2020) Top reasons cited for budget overruns are that the initial project scope was expanded and that unanticipated technical or organizational change management issues resulted in additional costs.

Gaining a better understanding of both project benefits and costs can help to develop an improved understanding of the project's total cost of ownership and help make the business case for a particular investment decision (see Chapter 9). Benefits of enterprise systems that can be used to make the business case include:

- ■ Improved availability of information
- ■ Increased interaction throughout the organization
- ■ Improved (reduced) lead times for manufacturing
- ■ Improved customer interaction
- ■ Reduced operating expenses
- ■ Reduced inventory
- ■ Reduced IS costs
- ■ Improved supplier integration
- ■ Improved compliance with standards, rules, and regulations

## FIGURE 7.15

The two mostly likely benefits realized from utilizing enterprise systems are improvements in information availability and increased interaction across the organization as a result of streamlining business processes.

Just as there are many possible benefits that can be realized when implementing an enterprise system, there are also many potential costs that can affect the total cost of ownership of these large and complex systems. Many companies underestimate these costs and, as a result, ultimately go over budget. Understanding all items that make up the total cost of ownership will help guide organizations into making better financial projections and project approval decisions. Beyond the system acquisition costs-for example, software licenses and maintenance costs, technical implementation, and hardware costs-other costs that are often overlooked when estimating project costs include:

- ■ Travel and training costs for personnel
- ■ Ongoing customization and integration costs
- ■ Business process studies
- ■ Project governance costs

If all costs are not considered, it can result in unexpected budget increases, delayed project timelines, and angry management. Next, we examine enterprise resource planning systems.

## Enterprise Resource Planning

Today, most enterprise-wide information systems come in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems . In the 1990s, we witnessed companies' initial push to implement integrated applications, as exhibited by skyrocketing sales of ERP systems at that time. Be aware that the terms resource and planning are somewhat misnomers, meaning that they only partially describe the purpose of ERP systems, since these applications do much more than just planning or managing resources. The reason for the term enterprise resource planning is that these systems evolved in part during the 1990s from material requirements planning and manufacturing resource planning packages. Do not get hung up on the words resource and planning . The key word to remember from the acronym ERP is enterprise .

ERP systems replace standalone applications by providing various modules based on a common database and similar application interfaces that serve the entire enterprise rather than portions of it. Data stored on legacy systems is converted into a large, centralized database that stores data related to the various business activities of an organization. Thus, ERP systems make accessing data easier by providing a central repository, giving personnel access to accurate, up-to-date information throughout the organization. For example, inventory data is accessible not only to inbound logistics and operations but also to accounting, sales, purchasing, and customer service personnel (Figure 7.15). Storing data in a single place and making it available to everyone within the organization empowers all employees in the organization to be aware of the current state of business and to perform their jobs better. In addition, many ERP systems support business processes of globally operating organizations. For example, the ERP systems of SAP, the German enterprise systems pioneer, have multilingual interfaces and automatically convert measurement units (e.g., kilograms to pounds or centimeters to inches) and currencies. This way, engineers in Germany, Spain, or Italy can input the bill of materials, manufacturing engineers and factory specialists can buy the parts and set up the production run, and marketing and sales staff in the United States can easily communicate with their clients.

<!-- image -->

ERP modules that access the database are designed to have the same look and feel regardless of the unique needs of a particular department. Inbound logistics and operations personnel will use a common user interface to access the same pieces of data from the shared database. Although the inbound logistics module and the operations module will have different features tailored to the unique needs of the business functions, the screens will look comparable, with similar designs, screen layouts, menu options, and so on. The Microsoft Office products provide a useful analogy. Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel are designed to provide different functions (word processing and spreadsheets, respectively), but overall, the products look and feel very similar to one another. Word and Excel have similar user interfaces but differ vastly in the purpose, features, and functionality that each application offers. Likewise, the look and feel of Microsoft Dynamics (Microsoft's suite of enterprise-wide information systems) resembles that of Microsoft Office to reduce the learning curve for most new users.

## Responding to Compliance and Regulatory Demands

In addition to helping improve business processes, ERP systems improve and ease an organization's ability to implement audit controls and comply with government-imposed regulations. Compliance  with  far-reaching  government  mandates  like  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  and  other evolving  and  emerging  regulatory  standards  is  based  on  the  implementation  and  documentation of internal controls, procedures, and processes. All ERP systems are designed to include an abundance of control features that can mirror an organization's business processes (e.g., controlling who has access to data and process steps, segregating duties across job functions, etc.). Such enterprise-wide capabilities provide organizations with tested solutions for developing and deploying a comprehensive compliance strategy. While the ERP system may not provide answers to all regulatory requirements, deploying an ERP system has been a central strategy for many organizations struggling to adhere to the myriad legal, regulatory, and supply chain mandates that are common in today's highly regulated business environment.

## Choosing an ERP System

When selecting an appropriate ERP system for an organization, management needs to take many factors into careful consideration. Although ERP systems come in a variety of shapes and sizes, each designed to accommodate certain transaction volumes, industries, and business processes, they come as packaged software, which means that they are designed to appeal to many different companies. However, businesses have unique needs even within their own industries. In other words, like snowflakes, no two companies are exactly alike. Management must carefully select an ERP system that will meet the unique requirements of its company and must consider a number of factors in the ERP selection. Among the most prevalent issues facing management are ERP control and ERP business requirements.

ERP CONTROL. ERP control refers to the locus of control over the computing systems and data contained in those systems as well as decision-making authority. Companies typically either opt for centralized control or allow different business units to govern themselves. In the context of ERP, these decisions are based on the level of detail in the information that must be provided to management. Some corporations want to have as much detail as possible made available at the executive level, whereas other companies do not require such access. For instance, an accountant in one company may want the ability to view costs down to the level of individual transactions, while an accountant in another company may want only summary information. Another area related to control involves the consistency of policies and procedures. Some companies prefer that policies and procedures remain consistent throughout an organization. Other companies want to allow each business unit to develop its own policies and procedures to accommodate the unique ways that they do business. ERP systems vary widely in their allowance for control, typically assuming either a corporate or a business-unit locus of control. Some ERP systems allow users to select or customize the locus of control. In either case, management must consider the ERP's stance on control to ensure that it will meet the business requirements of the company.

ERP BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. When selecting an ERP system, organizations must choose which modules to implement from a large menu of options-most organizations adopt only a subset of the available ERP components. There are two major categories of ERP componentsERP core components and ERP extended components (Figure 7.16).

## FIGURE   7.  16

## SECURITY MATTERS

## To Update or Not to Update,   That Shouldn't Be the Question

Virtually all commercial software has known or unknown security flaws. When such flaws are detected, the software vendor typically provides an update. Recall getting occasional updates on your personal computer, tablet, or smartphone. Such updates often provide a new capability, but more often than not, they provide updates to fix a discovered security problem.

versions of the ERP without extensive rewriting and testing. So, rather than modifying the customized modules to be compatible with the ERP's latest release, many organizations literally 'roll the dice' by keeping the older generating software so that they can continue to use their custom-designed features.

for example, in December 2019, cybersecurity firm onapsis noted that many customers take months or years to apply security updates to their enterprise systems. onapsis frequently works with ERP providers such as oracle and identified a vulnerability that could allow attackers to create entries in an unpatched system that allowed for fraudulent payments to an external bank account-without approvals by  the  firm!  The  security  vulnerability  was  identified 18 months previously, and an update was released in April 2019. unfortunately, firms often do not keep their enterprise updated to current security patches.

you might ask, 'Why wouldn't the company update its software?' Well, there is no single reason for this. In fact, there are many reasons why organizations fail to upgrade software to its latest version. for example, some may not upgrade because  they  feel  that  some  new  features  may not be needed or be necessary. others may avoid an upgrade to avoid paying associated upgrading fees. Some may conclude that the system is running fine as is, so 'why fix what isn't broken?' However, for ERP software, the biggest reason for organizations not to update outdated software is that many of these systems have been customized to a particular organization's manner of working and business processes. These custom software modules are often not compatible with the latest failing to upgrade an ERP system is especially problematic and risks much more than losing some old text messages or photos. A single ERP system can support hundreds of different business process; the databases can be massive, often larger than many terabytes. ERP systems touch nearly every aspect of an organization, from sales to production and inventory to payroll. given their massive size, scope, and complexity, a system failure can literally bankrupt a company. Just as you should always run updates on your computer and smartphone, so too should organizations. Which risk is greater, a change in business processes or bankruptcy? While the risks may be low, many companies are making the wrong choice when it comes to updating their ERP software.

ERP Core Components ERP core components support the important internal activities of the organization for producing its products and services. These components support internal operations such as the following:

1. Financial Management. Components to support accounting, financial reporting, performance management, and corporate governance
2. Operations Management. Components to simplify, standardize, and automate business processes related to inbound and outbound logistics, product development, manufacturing, and sales and service
3. Human Resource Management. Components to support employee recruitment, assignment tracking, performance reviews, payroll, and regulatory requirements

Whereas the operations management components enable the core activities of the value chain, financial management and human resources management are associated with activities supporting the core activities (Figure 7.17).

ERP Extended Components ERP extended components support the primary external activities of the organization for dealing with suppliers and customers. Specifically, ERP extended components focus primarily on supply chain management and customer relationship management. Both are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.

## Enabling Business Processes Using ERP Core Components

To fit the needs of various businesses in different industries, an ERP system's core components are typically implemented using a building-block approach through a series of modules that support internally  focused  business  processes.  For  example,  Oracle's  JD  Edwards  EnterpriseOne  offers more than 70 different modules to support a variety of business processes. ERP vendors typically package the various modules that enable industry-specific processes and offer such systems as 'industry solutions.' This way, organizations must spend less effort in selecting the needed modules and can more easily implement the ERP system. For instance, SAP's ERP application is built around modules that are modeled after the best practices for 25 different industries. Depending on the industries, the modules are localized for different countries: Whereas the modules for the automotive industry are localized for Japan or Germany, the modules for apparel and footwear industries are localized for China and India, the modules for the pharmaceutical industry are localized for Germany and the United States, and so on. Similarly, Microsoft offers its Dynamics ERP system for various industries, including construction, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and others (Table 7.1). Depending on the way processes are typically performed in an industry, the modules within each industry-specific ERP system work together to enable the business processes needed to run a business efficiently and effectively. However, the modules provided by different vendors may vary in

the specific business processes they support as well as in what they are called, and it is critical for managers to understand the vendors' naming conventions and software modules to gain an understanding of how these features can be implemented to support the company's business processes.

ORDER-TO-CASH. As discussed, the order-to-cash process entails the processes related to selling goods or services. Depending on the industry, the order-to-cash process can be very simple or extremely complex. In a retail environment, this process can be as simple as capturing product data, modifying the sale price (if needed), processing payment cards, and processing loyalty cards for customer profiling purposes. For a wholesale distributor, the order-to-cash process is more elaborate and consists of price quotation, stock allocation, credit limit check, picking, packing, shipping, billing, and receiving payment. For these processes to take place, different modules of the financial and operations management components work together. For example, the financial management component provides modules for checking credit limits, billing, and processing incoming payments. The operations management component provides modules related to sales and warehouse management operations, such as price quotation, stock allocation, picking, packing, and shipping (Figure 7.18).

PROCURE-TO-PAY. Recall that a generic procure-to-pay process entails negotiating price and terms, issuing purchase orders, receiving the goods, receiving the invoice, and settling the payment. As the order-to-cash process differs between industries, so does the procure-to-pay process. A grocery store, for example, typically orders a standard assortment of products but also faces additional constraints such as having to optimize order quantities, considering not only demand and storage costs but also seasonality and perishability of products. In contrast, a construction company procures diverse materials, depending on the project at hand, and the procurement process could entail a lengthy sourcing process, including requests for quotations, a bidding process, reviewing of bids, awarding the contract, and thoroughly inspecting the delivered products or materials (see also Chapter 9 for the process of purchasing a new information system). Similar to the order-to-cash process, different modules of the

financial management and operations management ERP components work together to enable the different activities related to the procure-to-pay process (Figure 7.19).

MAKE-TO-STOCK/MAKE-TO-ORDER. The processes related to producing goods differ widely between different industries. The biggest distinction is between the make-to-stock and make-to-order processes. As indicated, the make-to-stock process is typically used for commodities, whereas the make-to-order process is used for highly customizable goods or big-ticket items (such as aircraft or highway bridges). Many beverage companies, for instance, use a make-to-stock approach, involving production planning, manufacturing, and quality control. In contrast, an aerospace company must start with planning the project and ordering subassemblies or raw materials with long lead times before planning and executing the production for each specific project and finally checking quality and shipping the product. Many of the activities associated with the production process are supported by the operations management component of an ERP system (Figure 7.20).

OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES. In addition to these business processes, ERP systems typically enable a variety of other generic as well as industry-specific business processes. Any business needs to manage its workforce, including managing the hiring processes, scheduling the workforce, recording time and attendance, processing payroll, managing benefits, and so on. All these processes are supported by the human resources management component of an

ERP system. Similarly, the financial management component supports generic processes such as financial and managerial accounting, corporate governance, and the like. Industry-specific processes and the modules supporting these can vary widely. For example, the business of an aircraft manufacturer consists to a large extent of aftermarket support; a retail chain, in contrast, needs modules supporting retail space planning and price and markdown management; a commercial real estate company needs modules for managing assets, leases, and common spaces; and a large part of an airline's operations is related to maintenance, repair, overhaul, flight operations, catering, and customer care.

## ERP Installation

Previously, we discussed how organizations can benefit from the integration of standalone systems; further, you learned how business processes can differ between industries. Thus, any organization considering the implementation of an ERP system must carefully evaluate the different options available not only in terms of the overall systems offered by different vendors but also in terms of the industry-specific solutions offered by the software vendors. An evaluation should entail the assessment of how far the different modules can support existing business processes, which modules may have to be added, and the extent to which existing business processes must be modified to fit the modules offered by the ERP system.

An activity that is widely underestimated, however, is the configuration of ERP systems. Whereas customization involves the programming of company-specific modules or changing how business processes are implemented within the system and is often discouraged, configuration is an activity to be performed during any ERP implementation. Specifically, the system must be configured to reflect the way an organization does business and the associated business rules. As one of the most important parts of an ERP system is the underlying company-wide database, setting up the database is key to a successful ERP implementation, and organizations must make countless decisions on how to configure hundreds or thousands of database tables to fit the business's needs. Similarly, organizations must make thousands of decisions related to the different business processes. For example, what should be the format of the unique identifier for a customer, when will a bill be considered overdue, what is considered the 'standard' method of shipping, and so on? To make all these decisions, a good understanding of the way the company does its business is needed. Hence, many organizations hire experienced business analysts or outside consultants to assist with these configuration tasks.

## ERP Limitations

While ERP systems can help organizations streamline business processes, give personnel access to accurate, up-to-date information throughout the organization, and better respond to regulatory demands, they also pose limitations. In particular, ERP systems typically require organizations to modify various business processes; once an ERP system is implemented, the company is virtually locked in, and it is very difficult to make further changes, limiting organizations' flexibility and agility when facing new external challenges. Typically, even small changes to the way processes are implemented in the ERP system require programming changes, leading to higher costs for ongoing system maintenance.

## Achieving Enterprise System Success

To summarize, the main objective of enterprise systems is to help achieve competitive advantage by streamlining business activities within and outside a company. However, many implementations  turn  out  to  be  costlier  and  more  time-consuming  than  originally  envisioned.  It  is  not uncommon to have projects that run over budget, meaning that identifying common problems and devising methods for dealing with these issues can prove invaluable to management.

Given these numbers, should businesses even attempt to tackle large IS projects? The answer is, in most cases, yes. Typically, organizations do not (or should not) start such projects for the sake of starting the projects; rather, organizations are trying to fix certain problems, such as inefficient or ineffective distribution, pricing, or logistics, or lack of compliance with government regulations. Further, businesses have realized that it is all but impossible to improve business processes without the support of information systems. Companies that have successfully installed enterprise systems are found to follow a basic set of recommendations related to enterprise

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Big ERP Systems Embracing Small Mobile Devices

As ERP technologies have transformed organizations of all sizes in all industries, mobile devices have transformed how people manage day-to-day activities and organizations. As a result, ERP vendors are rapidly evolving their systems to better support managers with a variety of mobile ERP applications so that managers will be able to take advantage of the functionality, data, and benefits of their ERP application not only in the office but also on the road, enabling real-time management. Mobile ERP applications can provide many benefits to an organization, including:

1. Improving Service Quality. Mobile ERP will allow remote workers access anytime to relevant customer information, improving service quality and responsiveness.
2. Improving Productivity. Mobile ERP will allow remote workers to access key resources when commuting or waiting in airports, improving productivity and reducing downtime.

Historically, ERP systems have not had a reputation of being user friendly. given the mainframe roots of most systems, high usability was not a priority. Vendors are working hard to improve usability, especially for mobile ERP. Early mobile ERP apps tried to do too much and, much like their desktop-based interfaces, were slow and cumbersome to use. To reduce complexity and improve usability, vendors are now creating apps designed to perform a narrow set of tasks related to a specific business problem. Each app can be streamlined to focus on one problem and is therefore fast and easy to use. ERP giant SAP , for example, has hundreds of different apps to perform specific tasks. While apps are helping with mobile access, such innovation and usability improvements are also being integrated into desktop systems, and overall, ERP systems are becoming much easier to use. With increasing digital density, organizations should choose ERP systems that have the capability and flexibility to integrate with an expanding array of mobile devices and platforms.

3. Strengthening Customer Relationships. Mobile ERP will allow remote workers to respond more quickly and have key customer information when needed to strengthen customer relationships.
4. Improving Competitive Advantage. Mobile ERP can speed responsiveness to customer needs, improving competitive advantage.

As with all large projects, governance and risk mitigation are critical to success, and companies should attempt to share both risks and rewards with the vendors. Although the following list is not meant to be comprehensive, these recommendations will provide an understanding of some of the challenges involved in implementing enterprise systems:

Recommendation 1. Secure executive sponsorship.

Recommendation 2. Get help from outside experts.

Recommendation 3. Thoroughly train users.

Recommendation 4. Take a multidisciplinary approach to implementations.

Recommendation 5. Evolve the implementation.

## Secure Executive Sponsorship

The primary reason why enterprise system implementations fail is believed to be a lack of toplevel  management  support.  Although  executives  do  not  necessarily  need  to  make  decisions concerning the enterprise system, it is critical that they buy into the decisions made by project managers. Many problems can arise if projects fail to grab the attention of top-level management. In most companies, executives have the ultimate authority regarding the availability and distribution of resources within the organization. If executives do not support the project, the probability of failure increases dramatically.

A second problem that may arise deals with top-level management's ability to authorize changes in the way the company does business. When business processes need to be changed to incorporate best practices, these modifications need to be completed. Otherwise, the company will have a piece of software that does not fit the way people accomplish their business tasks. Also, as people, in general, are reluctant to change the way they are working, there is bound to be resistance to the implementation of an ERP system. If users and midlevel management perceive the enterprise system to be unimportant, they are not likely to view it as a priority. Enterprise systems require a concentrated effort, and executive sponsorship can propel or stifle the implementation.

## Get Help from Outside Experts

Enterprise systems are complex. Even the most talented IS departments can struggle in coming to grips with any enterprise-level system. Most vendors have trained project managers and experienced consultants to assist companies with installing these complex systems. Using consultants tends to move companies through the implementation more quickly and tends to help companies train their personnel on the applications more effectively. However, companies should not rely too heavily on support from the vendors. The salespeople's job is, after all, selling a system, and they are unlikely to thoroughly understand the company's exact business needs. Thus, organizations should also draw on external consultants to help define the functionality before selecting a vendor and to ensure that all requirements are incorporated in the contract with the vendor. Once the application goes live and the consultants are no longer there, users must do the job themselves. A key focus should, therefore, be facilitating user learning.

## Thoroughly Train Users

Training is often the most overlooked, underestimated, and poorly budgeted expense involved in planning enterprise system implementations. Enterprise systems are much more complicated to learn than standalone systems. Learning a single application requires users to become accustomed to a new software interface, but enterprise system users typically need to learn a new set of business processes, as well. Once enterprise systems go live, many companies initially experience a dramatic drop-off in productivity. This issue can potentially lead to heightened levels of dissatisfaction among users, as they prefer to accomplish their business activities in a familiar manner rather than doing things the new way. By training users before the system goes live and giving them sufficient opportunities to learn the new system, a company can allay fears and mitigate potential productivity issues.

## Take a Multidisciplinary Approach to Implementations

Enterprise systems affect the entire organization; thus, companies should include personnel from different levels and departments on the implementation team. In customer relationship management and supply chain management environments in which other organizations are participating in the implementation, it is critical to enlist the support of personnel in their organizations as well. During implementation, project managers need to include personnel from midlevel management, the IS department, external consultants, and, most important, end users.

Failing to include the appropriate people in the day-to-day activities of the project can prove problematic in many areas. From a needs-analysis standpoint, it is critical that all the business requirements be sufficiently captured before selecting an enterprise solution. Because end users are involved in every aspect of daily business activities, their insights can be invaluable. For instance, an end user might make salient a feature that no one on the project team had thought of. Having an application that does not meet all the business's requirements can result in poorly fitting software or customizations. Another peril in leaving out key personnel is the threat of alienation. Departments and/or personnel who do not feel included may develop a sense of animosity toward the new system and view it in a negative light. In extreme cases, users will refuse to use the new application, resulting in conflicts and inefficiencies within the organization.

## Evolve the Implementation

As you can see, implementing ERP systems is a highly complex undertaking; although a successful implementation can have huge payoffs for an organization, some organizations fear losing the ability to quickly respond to changing business requirements, particularly because large

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## Jobs Need COBOL? COBOL Needs Jobs?

The Common Business-oriented Language (CoBoL) was developed in the late 1950s as an English-based language that, over time, had proven especially efficient at processing financial transactions. Even as of 2017, Reuters reported that 43 percent of banking systems and 95 percent of ATM transactions still used CoBoL programs. In fact, CoBoL is so useful and efficient that, instead of replacing ancient CoBoL code with programs written in more modern languages such as Java or Python, organizations instead choose to patch and update the old software as it worked perfectly for their needs-that is, until unusual, out of the ordinary demands impacted these systems, such as tens of millions of Americans filing for unemployment benefits in a short amount of time because of the coronavirus pandemic.

intervene. However, this thinking made another fact clear. Those that rely on the CoBoL language did not properly account for the risks associated with updating and maintaining software written in a dead language. Although CoBoL is dead, it won't be phased out any time soon as CoBoL job skills are and will continue to be in demand by employers.

In March and April of 2020, systems that were responsible for processing unemployment benefits became overloaded by the massive number of new unemployment requests that had been submitted by those that had lost their jobs due to the effects of CoVID-19 on the economy. The increased load resulted in a failure for states to process claims and disburse benefits to those that needed help. The failure was so dire that governors from several states literally pleaded for anyone with CoBoL experience to assist, so that the systems could be updated. What was widely considered a dead language was now of the greatest demand by governments and financial institutions. So, the question must be asked: how did we end up here? The easy answer is the software worked, so as long as it worked there was no need to

ERP systems are difficult to install, maintain, and upgrade. In addition, the life cycle of a large ERP installation is typically 10 to 15 years. A recent trend, especially for small and mid-sized companies, is to move away from such large, comprehensive in-house systems toward cloudbased ERP solutions, with almost two-thirds of organizations opting for cloud-based ERP systems (  Panorama, 2020  ). As with other cloud-based solutions, companies implementing cloud-based ERP can benefit from scalability and agility. In addition, many companies extending into new markets are extending their existing ERP systems with cloud-based solutions. Such two-tier ERP strategies can support operations at the corporate level while providing the needed flexibility and agility at the subsidiary level. This can be especially beneficial when entering global markets, as the cloud-based solutions can be easily adapted to local needs and regulations without having to make extensive changes to the core ERP system.

Another key trend is the ability to manage a business in real time. With the costs of sensors decreasing at a tremendous pace   (see   Chapter   1  )  , organizations are now able to acquire data about various operational processes in real time. Being able to use this data for business decisions is regarded as critical for successfully competing in the digital world. Traditionally, organizations separated the processing of transactions from the analysis   (see   Chapter   6  , 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence')   in order to prevent the analytical applications from slowing down the transaction processing. Even then, batch transactions could take hours, and decision makers could not get quick answers to pressing business questions, as transactional data were loaded only periodically into the analytical systems and the data needed for real-time business intelligence were just not available. New technology,

using in-memory computing   (see   Chapter   3  )  , can help to tremendously increase processing speed by reducing disk latency while at the same time enabling the removal of the distinction between transactional and analytical systems. Paired with the continuing trend of mobile access to ERP systems, this enables managers to manage business in real time and quickly respond to changes as they occur.

Although expansive enterprise system implementations are often cumbersome and difficult, the potential payoff is huge. As a result, organizations are compelled to implement these systems. Further, given the popularity and necessity of integrating systems and processes on an organization-wide basis, you are likely to find yourself involved in the implementation and/or use of such a system. We are confident that after reading this chapter, you will be better able to understand and help with the development and use of such systems.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## The Automobile Industry

There are more than 1.4 billion cars and light trucks on the road throughout the world, a number that is estimated to reach almost 3 billion by 2036. 90 million vehicles were sold worldwide in 2019, with China alone accounting for more than 21 million vehicles sold. In addition, countries such as Brazil, Russia, and India and other emerging economies (especially in Southeast Asia) will significantly contribute to this growth.

Currently, there is growing global demand for technologically advanced, energy-efficient vehicles. Since 2006, the 'World Car of the year' has been selected by a large jury of international automotive journalists from 28 countries. In addition to the overall winner, there are other categories including luxury, performance, and green automobiles. The overall winners in recent years-the Volvo XC60 (2014), Jaguar I-Pace (2019), and Kia Telluride (2020)-are all energy efficient (the Jaguar is electric), leverage the latest technologies, and pack incredible safety features in a   modest size.

In the meantime, the automobile industry continues to explore other ways of responding to global market demands. Many automobile manufacturers have dramatically evolved their global networks of suppliers (such as Bosch and Continental from germany, Magna and Lear from the united States, and yazaki from Japan), leveraging these broad supply chains to bring new innovations to market, ranging from smartphone data ports to storage for music, video, mobile data connectivity, and onboard apps. In addition, manufacturers and technology companies are finding interesting ways to make cars safer and more convenient. Electric cars are also gaining a growing market share. In 2013, just over 400,000 electrical vehicles were sold globally; in 2019, this number grew to nearly 3 million. In late 2019, germany became Europe's largest electric vehicle market, at more than 100,000 in new electric car sales.

Another coming trend in this market is driverless cars. for several years, Alphabet's Waymo has famously been working on technology to support a self-driving car. The system drives the car at the speed limit it has stored from its mapping database and maintains distance from other vehicles using an array of sensors. In addition to Waymo, many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers are focusing a lot of their R&amp;D budgets on driverless cars. Key players include not only Alphabet but also ford, general Motors, Tesla, Baidu, and numerous universities around the world.

## Key Points Review

1. Explain core business processes that are common in organizations. Most organizations are organized around distinct functional areas that work together to execute the core business processes order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, and make-to-stock/order. Together, these core business processes enable the creation of value chains that are involved in transforming raw materials into products sold to the end consumer. Value chains are composed of both core activities (inbound logistics, operations and manufacturing, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and customer service) and support activities (administrative activities, infrastructure, human resources, technology development, and procurement). Companies connect their value chains with suppliers and customers, creating value systems such that information flows from one company's value chain to another company's value chain.
2. Describe what enterprise systems are and how they have evolved. Enterprise systems are information systems that span the entire organization and can be used to integrate business processes, activities, and information across all the functional areas of a firm. Enterprise systems evolved from legacy systems that supported distinct organizational activities by combining data and applications into a single comprehensive system and can be either prepackaged software or custom-made applications. The implementation of enterprise systems often involves business process management-a systematic, structured improvement approach by all or part of an
3. organization that critically examines, rethinks, and redesigns processes to achieve dramatic improvements in one or more performance measures, such as quality, cycle time, or cost.
3. Describe enterprise resource planning systems and how they help to improve internal business processes. ERP systems allow information to be shared throughout the organization using a large database, helping to streamline business processes and improve customer service. When selecting an ERP system, organizations must choose which modules to implement from a large menu of options-most organizations adopt only a subset of the available ERP components. ERP core components support the major internal activities of the organization for producing its products and services, while ERP extended components support the primary external activities of the organization for dealing with suppliers and customers.
4. Understand and utilize the keys to successfully implementing enterprise systems. Experience with enterprise system implementations suggests that there are some common problems that can be avoided and/ or should be managed carefully. Organizations can avoid common implementation problems by (1) securing executive sponsorship, (2) getting necessary help from outside experts, (3) thoroughly training users, (4) taking a multidisciplinary approach to implementations, and (5) keeping track of evolving ERP trends.

## CASE 1 Software as a Service: ERP by the Hour

As you know by now, an organization's IS infrastructure is not simple to construct or maintain but is a complex infrastructure of servers and databases useful for managing large  amounts  of  information.  With advances in cloud computing, software as a service (SaaS) has appeared as a model of IS infrastructure and software and is rapidly changing the way many organizations do business. SaaS is a way for organizations to use cloud-based internet services to accomplish the goals that traditional IS infrastructure and software models have in the past. SaaS allows software application vendors to deploy their products over the internet through web-based services. SaaS customers pay to use applications on demand, giving them the freedom to access a software service only when needed. Applications and software are developed, hosted, and operated by SaaS vendors, and customers are charged on a pay-per-use basis. Once the customer's 'license' expires, the customer no longer has to carry the cost of the software. If a future need for the software arises, the customer simply orders it again to have access. SaaS products can be licensed for single or multiple users within the organization, making them flexible and scalable.

Using the SaaS model has several advantages. Through SaaS applications, organizations can move their data storage into the cloud, reducing the cost of buying storage and diminishing the risk of catastrophic data loss, as it is in the vendor's financial interest to keep the services it provides running at peak performance or risk losing customers to another vendor. In addition, SaaS allows for less resource expenditure on long-term software licensing because an organization can get what it needs when it needs it. SaaS utilization also allows organizations to become more productive outside the physical confines of their buildings. Because SaaS services are in the cloud, employees can access services from remote offices or from their mobile devices.

One of the main disadvantages of SaaS is that customers must give up some autonomy over their applications and data. Some organizations require specialized software solutions and are used to customizing software in-house to meet their needs. Although some SaaS vendors are beginning to offer customizable solutions, the problem is still a roadblock for some. Computing off-site also means that security may be an issue, as organizational operations and data are effectively  running  on  someone else's server. As it is virtually impossible for some types of organizations to keep their data-and their secrets-in the cloud, such concerns are another roadblock that organizations  must  overcome  to  use  SaaS products.

These disadvantages aside, organizations are reaping the benefits of SaaS, utilizing them for human resources activities, email services, collaboration efforts, storage solutions, and financial tasks such as billing, invoicing, and timekeeping. In addition to more general-purpose applications, many organizations are deploying

ERP capabilities via SaaS vendors. And the growth of the SaaS industry doesn't appear to be slowing. In fact, a recent study by Gartner found that the global SaaS market is projected to grow from US$86 billion in 2018 to US$151 billion in 2022.

Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have become well-known SaaS vendors offering a range of services t o  organizations,  including  shareddocument management, communication services, cloud-based email, calendars, photo  and  video  sharing,  web  and intranet page management, and data storage services, just to name a few. Given the challenges and issues associated with implementing in-house enterprise systems,  ERP  vendors  are  increasingly offering their software as a service as well. For example, SAP offers SAP Business ByDesign, an integrated on-demand ERP solution for small and mediumsized enterprises. Similarly, Microsoft offers its Dynamics customer relationship management system as a service, and Oracle offers the subscription-based Oracle On Demand customer relationship management solution.

As more organizations continue to adopt SaaS services as a way of carrying out their day-to-day activities, vendors will continue to upgrade and expand the available technologies for use. The question of whether organizations will adopt SaaS services has, for the most part, been answered. The question has now become how much of their business they will put in the cloud.

## CASE 2 Amazon's Automation and T echnological Unemployment

'Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History.' So reads a sign above the entrance to many of Amazon's fulfillment centers throughout the world. Inside these massive fulfillment centers, millions of products are waiting to be shipped to the doorsteps of customers. Historically, human pickers walked the isles of these warehouses, pushing carts with baskets as they deposited items that were awaiting to be shipped to someone, from somewhere, who ordered the product online. More and more, robots are being used to support, and many times replace, these human workers.

warehouses, Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in 26 of its fulfilment centers.

While the data are constantly changing, in July 2020 Amazon operated over 175 fulfillment centers across the world to handle orders, sorting, and delivery for Amazon  and  Amazon  Prime  customers.  In addition to the United States, fulfillment centers are located in countries such as Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, Poland, China, Japan, India, and Brazil. The United States alone has more than 110 facilities, with many larger than 1 million square feet. With such a network, Amazon provides same-day delivery to an increasing number of cities including New York City, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle, among others. Amazon has been very strategic about where it places centers and has even started opening smaller,  reduced selection warehouses closer to big cities to speed up delivery times. Clearly, Amazon is now competing with many local businesses that always had the advantage of same-day delivery.

integrating robots into the order fulfillment process. An average human picker at a fulfillment center can pick around 1,000 items a day. While humans have fueled Amazon's success in the order fulfillment process, humans are becoming the weak link as facilities get bigger and competition necessitates faster and less costly processes. Robots don't get tired, don't need to take lunch or bathroom breaks, can work 24 hours per day, and will only make mistakes if the databases driving their operations contain an error. There are, however, many tasks that humans can perform better than robots, at least at this time. For example, robots are still incapable of tasks that require fine manipulation or improvisation. Because of this, Amazon and other large retailers are exploring ways for robots to collaborate with humans in more effective ways. In line with this, Amazon acquired robotics manufacturer Kiva Systems in 2012 and integrated it into its subsidiary Amazon Robotics.

As Amazon races for fast order fulfillment and reducing costs, it is very actively

Historically, automation has often been viewed as a double-edged sword, providing both benefits and problems for society. Benefits could include the elimination of dangerous jobs, but at the same time, the technology also creates unemployment and possible injury due to increased speed of work. Over the years, while technology eliminated some jobs, it often was the catalyst for the creation of new types of jobs, often with better pay. When automation was brought to family farms, for example, a single farmer could work much larger farms, producing enough food for many families. Such productivity gains resulted in the elimination of many farming jobs. These displaced farmers often then moved to the city to work in factories to produce even greater productivity gains in farming and other industries.

One approach for utilizing robots is to fundamentally change the picking process. Rather than have workers walk the aisles of these massive warehouses, why not have the shelves come to the pickers? These robotic shelves, sitting atop a small robot about the size of a footstool, know which products are on its shelves. Computer control guides these shelves to a particular picker, who can select the next product needed for an order at more than 2.5 times faster than without robots. After the product is picked, the robot can simultaneously optimize the movement and sequence of countless numbers of shelves. The shelves can be kept very close to one another as they wait for inventory replenishments or to deliver a product to a picker. Shelves can also be packed tighter. As this process is much more efficient than having humans walk around massive

As the digital world accelerates change, emerging technologies like industrial robots, artificial  intelligence,  3D  printing,  and machine learning are forecasted to eliminate a variety of jobs at a pace faster than ever before. When automation kills more jobs than it produces in other industries, this is called technological unemployment. Historically, such widespread fears of technological unemployment have been viewed as a Luddite fallacy, but now, many fear that a tipping point has been reached where technology will rapidly eliminate not only blue-collar jobs needing manual labor but also many jobs where humans make decisions, so-called whitecollar jobs. In fact, some 47 percent of present jobs in the United States could be computerized in the next 10 to 20 years, according to an Oxford University study. How far and how fast this change appears will have a tremendous impact on the digital world.
