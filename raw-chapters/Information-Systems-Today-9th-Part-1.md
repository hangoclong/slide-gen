## Managing in the Digital World

## Preview

In the past decades, technology has progressed tremendously,  and  the  digital  connection  of  people,  things, and  organizations  has  accelerated  exponentially.  Not only  has  this  increasing  digital  density  helped  organizations from Apple to Zappos to better manage their organizations, provide high-quality goods and services, or gain or sustain competitive advantage over rivals, it has also contributed to tremendous changes in all areas of society. Our objective for this chapter is to help you understand the role of information systems as we continue to move further into the digital world, the role of  information  systems  in  current  issues  faced  by  societies  in  the  digital  world,  and  the  role  of  increasing digital density in influencing the digital future. We then highlight what information systems are, how they have evolved to become a vital part of modern organizations, and why this understanding is necessary for you to become  an  effective  manager  in  the  digital  world.  We conclude  by  discussing  ethical  issues  associated  with the use of information systems.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Open Innovation

W here do good ideas come from?  An  eccentric inventor toiling alone? A secretive lab filled with researchers in white coats? Views of innovation are shifting away from these traditional stereotypes. For decades, corporations funded internal  research  and  development  units  and  tightly controlled both the inputs and outputs of these operations.  Opportunities to interact with customers were limited,  and  the  possibility  of  spending  months  or years and millions of dollars developing products that no one wanted was a real threat. New technologies are enabling a shift in the way innovation occurs.

Traditionally, universities would conduct basic and   applied research,  but  the  results  of  this  research  only  sometimes would make their way to the private sector. Corporations would fund their own research and development operations, often at great expense. Such operations took years to set up and were often highly constrained in the types of research they could carry out. Programs of research were evaluated against business plans that had been studied, reviewed, and approved by multiple layers of management. The time and complexity involved in these bureaucratic processes often left the actual research out of date and out of touch with the realities of the marketplace and actual customer wants and needs. The resulting products would often fail in the market due to being years late or no longer being relevant.

Open innovation is a new approach. Instead of relying on tightly controlled internal research projects, companies

After this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Describe the characteristics of the digital world, contemporary societal issues of the digital world, and how increasing digital density is shaping the digital future.
2.  Explain what an information system is, contrasting its data, technology, people, and organizational components.
3.  Describe the dual nature of information systems in the success and failure of modern organizations.
4.  Describe how computer ethics affect the use of information systems and discuss the ethical concerns associated with information privacy and intellectual property.

are opening up their research and development efforts to a broad audience (Figure 1.1). Customers, suppliers, and other companies are invited to participate more directly in different phases of the innovation process, and companies are working more collaboratively with universities.

Many companies take these ideas even further and open up the research and development efforts to anyone who wishes to participate online or in person. For example,  Starbucks  introduced  'My  Starbucks  Idea,' where customers can post ideas and suggestions as well as vote on or discuss others' ideas. Hundreds of customergenerated ideas have been implemented over the years. Heineken's 'Innovators Brewhouse' uses open innovation  to  generate  ideas  related  to  topics  ranging  from methods for counterfeit detection to brewing closer to the consumer, creating more convenient packaging, and even  accelerating  ideas  for  bringing  new  products  to market. Open innovation has also linked experts across industries and disciplines to tackle the urgent health challenges of the day such as fighting COVID-19. Further, new tools like interactive 3D visualization and rapid prototyping technologies like 3D printing allow for tremendously lowered barriers to entry to innovation. Many companies and institutions have set up collaborative spaces to share resources  and  encourage the fusion of ideas and skills that can lead to exciting breakthroughs. As with many innovations  themselves,  this  way  of  innovating  would not be possible without information systems.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to   answer the following:

## Information Systems Today

Today, information systems (IS) are ubiquitous: Be it traditional desktop computers, laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, you name it, information systems are all around us, whether you see them or not. Companies such as FedEx and UPS use information systems to route trucks and track packages. Retailers such as Walgreens and Walmart use information systems for everything from optimizing supply chains to recording purchases and analyzing customer tastes and preferences. Cities use information systems for adaptive traffic control systems or variable speed limits. Cars use information systems for everything from ignition control to airbags to distance control and park assist systems. Many innovative business models (summaries of business's strategic directions that outline how the objectives will be achieved), ranging from Airbnb to Uber, are built on or around information systems. Alternatively, just look around your school or place of work. At your school, you register for classes online; use email, Twitter, or other social media to  communicate with fellow students and your instructors; access e-books from your library; and complete or submit assignments on online learning platforms such as Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas, or Sakai. At work, you may use a PC for email and many other tasks. Your paychecks are probably generated by computer and automatically deposited into your bank account via highspeed networks. Even (and especially) in your spare time, information systems are ubiquitous: You use social networking sites like Facebook or TikTok to stay connected with your friends and family, you watch videos on YouTube, you upload pictures taken with your smartphone to picture-sharing sites like Instagram, you listen to music on Pandora or Spotify, and you use your smartphone for playing games, sending emails, navigating through your city, purchasing concert tickets, or reading books. Chances are that each year you see more information systems than you did the year before, and these systems are a more fundamental and important part of your social, academic, and work life than ever before.

## The Emergence of the Digital World

Over the past decades, the advent of powerful, relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use computers has had a major impact on business and society. When you stop and think about it, it is easy to see why information systems are important. Increasing global competitiveness has forced companies to find ways to be better and to do things less expensively. The answer for many firms continues to  be  to  use  information systems to do things better, faster, and cheaper. Many organizations use  information  systems  to  support  innovative  business  models  or  build  their  entire  business models around technological innovations. Likewise, using global telecommunications networks, companies can more easily integrate their operations to access new markets for their products and services as well as access a large pool of talented workers no matter where they are located.

Clearly, we are living in a digital world. With the proliferation of mobile devices-such as tablets or smartphones-and the possibility to connect things -ranging from tennis shoes to wind turbines-we are now living in the post-PC era, where connected devices are replacing traditional desktop and laptop computers. In fact, already in the last quarter of 2011, Apple sold more iPads than HP (traditionally one of the world's leading PC makers) sold PCs (Nielsen, 2016). Initially created as consumer devices, tablets are now commonplace in various professional settings, including warehouses, showrooms, airplane cockpits, and hospitals (Figure 1.2). Devices with newer form factors work in tandem with older form factors to provide truly ubiquitous experiences; mobile devices complement traditional computers, providing different devices for different users and different tasks, where not the device but the services and data provided are of primary importance. Further, the changes we have seen so far have given rise to developments such as wearable computers, augmented reality devices, or surface computers.

Changes in technology have enabled new ways of working and socializing; whereas in the past, people were bound to a stationary PC to do essential tasks, they are not bound to any particular location any more. Likewise, workdays traditionally had a clear beginning and a clear end-from when you powered your computer on to when you turned it off at night. Today, many tasks (especially more casual tasks such as reading or sending emails) can be done at any time, often in small chunks in between other tasks, such as when waiting in line at the supermarket cashier.

Computing has changed from an activity primarily focused on automating work to providing new benefits and services, and to encompass various social and casual activities. Devices such as smartphones or tablets, paired with mobile broadband networks, allow for instant-on

computing experiences, whenever and wherever; advances in cloud computing (think Gmail, Office 365, or Dropbox) allow for accessing emails, files, notes, and the like from different devices, further enhancing portability and mobility.

In effect, we are in a virtuous cycle (or in a vicious cycle, considering the creep of work life into people's leisure time and the increasing fixation on being permanently 'on call'), where changes in technology lead to social changes and social changes shape technological changes. For example, communication, social networking, and online investing almost necessitate mobility and connectivity, as people have grown accustomed to checking email, posting status updates, or checking on real-time stock quotes while on the go. In addition, the boundaries between work and leisure time are blurring, so that employees increasingly demand devices that can support both and often bring their own devices into the workplace.

KNOWLEDGE WORKERS AND THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY. In 1959, Peter Drucker predicted that information and information systems would become increasingly important, and at that point, more than 60 years ago, he coined the term knowledge worker . Knowledge workers are typically professionals who are relatively well educated and who create, modify, and/or synthesize knowledge as a fundamental part of their jobs.

Drucker's predictions about knowledge workers were accurate. As he predicted, they are generally paid better than their prior agricultural and industrial counterparts; they rely on and are empowered by formal education, yet they often also possess valuable real-world skills; they are continually learning how to do their jobs better; they have much better career opportunities and far more bargaining power than workers ever had before. Knowledge workers make up about a quarter of the workforce in the United States and in other developed nations, and their numbers are rising quickly.

Drucker also predicted that, with the growth in the number of knowledge workers and with their rise in importance and leadership, a knowledge society would emerge. He reasoned that, given the importance of education and learning to knowledge workers and the firms that need them, education would become the cornerstone of the knowledge society. Possessing knowledge, he argued, would be as important as possessing land, labor, or capital (if not more so) (Figure 1.3). Indeed, research shows that people equipped to prosper in the knowledge society, such as those with a college education, earn far more on average than people without a college education, and that gap is increasing. In fact, the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (2018 data) reinforce the value of a college education: Median earnings for workers 25 and over with a bachelor's degree were US$50,515 a year, while those for workers with a high school diploma were US$27,868. Median earnings for workers with a graduate or professional degree were US$66,944, and for those without a high school diploma US$19,954. These data suggest that a bachelor's degree is worth about US$1 million in additional lifetime earnings compared to a worker with only a high school diploma. Additionally, getting a college degree will qualify you for many jobs that would not

be available to you otherwise and will distinguish you from other job candidates. Finally, a college degree is often a requirement to qualify for career advancement and promotion opportunities once you do get that job.

People generally agree that Drucker was accurate about knowledge workers and the evolution of society. While people have settled on Drucker's term knowledge worker , there are many alternatives to the term knowledge society . Others have referred to this phenomenon as the knowledge economy , the new economy , the digital society , the network era , the internet era , and other names. We simply refer to this as the digital world . All these ideas have in common the premise that information and related technologies and systems have become indispensable and that knowledge workers are vital.

Today, not only knowledge workers use information systems as integral parts of their work lives; many 'traditional' occupations now increasingly use information systemsfrom the UPS package delivery person using global positioning system (GPS) technology to take the best route to deliver parcels to the farmer in Iowa who uses precision agriculture to plan the use of fertilizers to increase crop yield. In essence, (almost) every organization can now be considered an e-business. An e-business is an organization that uses information technologies or systems to support nearly every part of its business. Thus, the lines between 'knowledge workers' and 'manual workers' are blurring. While now almost every worker can be considered a knowledge worker, workers of the future need to become learning workers , as not the knowledge itself, but the knowledge of how to learn will be of primary importance.

THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. Some have argued, however, that there is a downside to being a knowledge worker and to living in the digital world. For example, some have argued that knowledge workers will be the first to be replaced by automation with information systems. Others have argued that in the new economy there is a digital divide , where those with access to information systems have great advantages over those without access to information systems. The digital divide is one of the major ethical challenges facing society today when you consider the strong linkage between computer literacy and a person's ability to compete in the digital world. For example, access to raw materials and money fueled the Industrial Revolution, 'but in the informational society, the fuel, the power, is knowledge,' emphasized John Kenneth Galbraith, an American economist who specialized in emerging trends in the U.S. economy. 'One has now come to see a new class structure divided by those who have information and those who must function out of ignorance. This new class has its power not from money, not from land, but from knowledge' (Galbraith, 1987).

The good news is that the digital divide in America is rapidly shrinking, but there are still major challenges to overcome. In particular, people in rural communities, the elderly, people with disabilities, and minorities lag behind national averages for internet access and computer literacy. Outside the United States and other developed countries, the gap gets even wider and the obstacles get much more difficult to overcome, particularly in the developing countries where infrastructure and financial resources are lacking. For example, most developing countries are lacking modern informational resources such as affordable internet access or efficient electronic payment methods.

To be sure, there is a downside to overreliance on information systems, but one thing is for certain: Knowledge workers and information systems are now critical to the success of modern organizations, economies, and societies. At the same time, information systems play a crucial role in various major issues societies face. These issues are examined next.

## Globalization and Societal Issues in the Digital World

The  past  decades  have  brought  about  a  number  of  dramatic  global  changes,  many  of  which will  continue  to  influence  individuals,  businesses,  economies,  and  societies  well  into  the future.  Many  of  such  interrelated  societal  'megatrends,'  discussed  by  consulting  firms  such as   PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Ernst &amp; Young (EY), local and national governments, or global political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum, are related to ever-increasing globalization -the integration of economies throughout the world, enabled by innovation and technological progress (  International Monetary Fund, 2002  ).  You can see the effects of globalization in many ways, such as the greater international movement of commodities, money, information, and labor as well as the development of technologies, standards, and processes to facilitate this movement.

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Memory Crystals

In the Superman films and many other sci-fi movies and books, characters make use of data storage devices that resemble large crystals. In the stories, these crystals often store incredibly large amounts of data and last for extraordinary lengths of time. Now scientists have taken a step toward making such technology a reality. Researchers at the University  of  Southampton  (UK)  have  created  a nanostructured glass storage device that resembles the fictional technologies. The technique uses self-assembling nanostructures  written  into  fused  quartz  using  tiny femtosecond (one-  quadrillionth, or one-millionth of onebillionth, of a second) laser light pulses. The data are encoded in five dimensions (5D): height, length, width, position, and orientation. Using these multiple dimensions along with the nanoscale laser writing allows a small glass disc, about the size of a large coin, to store 360 terabytes (TB) of data. As a terabyte is equal to 1,024 gigabytes (gB), the amount of data stored on each tiny disk is several hundred times the amount of data stored on a standard desktop computer (1-4 TB) and several thousand times the data storage capacity of most smartphones (32-256 gB). The quartz material is highly stable (up to 13.8 billion years at room temperature and can survive a maximum of 1,000 degrees Celsius), so data can be archived essentially forever.

To demonstrate the technology, the scientists recorded several major documents from human history on the disks, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton's Opticks , the Magna Carta, and the King James Bible. The technology could be used by any organization or business seeking to store large volumes of data for long periods of time. Museums, libraries, national archives, and others could preserve their information and records for nearly unlimited time. Data stored using the technique could well outlast any other aspects of not just our technology but our civilization, ensuring that evidence of our past will live forever. As a first test of preserving our history, SpaceX has already launched a copy of Asimov's Foundation on 5D storage to space, riding co-pilot with Elon Musk's Starman.

GLOBALIZATION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. For organizations, globalization has opened up many opportunities, brought about by falling transportation and telecommunication costs. Today, shipping a bottle of wine from Australia to Europe costs merely a few cents, and people can make voice or video calls around the globe for free using services such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or WhatsApp. To a large extent fueled by movies, television, and other forms of media, the increasing globalization has moved cultures closer together. The streaming movie provider Netflix is available in many countries, people in all corners of the world can receive television programming from other countries, and major movies are increasingly international. Developments such as these help create a shared understanding about norms of behavior or interaction, desirable goods or services, or even forms of government (though technology has also facilitated an increase in authoritarianism and restrictions on free flow of communication and content on the internet, such as on the popular social media WeChat and TikTok). The rapid rise of a new middle class in many developing countries has enabled established companies to reach new markets, enabling them to sell their products to literally millions of new customers. At the same time, with the decrease in communication costs, companies can now draw on a large pool of skilled professionals from all over the globe. Countries such as Russia, China, and India offer high-quality education, leading to an ample supply of well-trained people. Some countries have even built entire industries around certain competencies, such as software development or tax preparation in India and call centers in Ireland.

The tremendous decrease in communication costs has increased the use of outsourcing -the moving of business processes or tasks (such as accounting, manufacturing, or security) to another company or another country-as now companies can outsource business processes on a global scale (Figure 1.4). Companies are choosing to outsource business activities for a variety of reasons; the most important reasons include the following:

- ■ To reduce or control costs
- ■ To free up internal resources
- ■ To gain access to world-class capabilities
- ■ To increase the revenue potential of the organization
- ■ To reduce time to market
- ■ To increase process efficiencies
- ■ To be able to focus on core activities
- ■ To compensate for a lack of specific capabilities or skills

Often, companies located in countries such as India can provide certain services much cheaper because of lower labor costs, or companies perform certain functions in a different country to reduce costs or harness skilled labor. For example, in India, two companies-Wipro and Infosys-have emerged as the leaders in providing IT services that range from business consulting to systems development. In addition, a wide variety of other services-ranging from telephone support to tax returns-are candidates for outsourcing to different countries, be it Ireland, China, or India. Even highly specialized services, such as reading of X-rays by skilled

<!-- image -->

radiologists, are outsourced by U.S. hospitals to doctors around the globe, often while doctors in the United States are sleeping.

Yet globalization has also brought about a number of operational challenges for organizations. Organizations face governmental challenges related to differences in political systems, regulatory environments, laws, standards, or individual freedoms. Likewise, geoeconomic challenges include differences in infrastructure, demographics, welfare, or workers' expertise. Lastly, organizations face cultural challenges, such as dealing with differences in languages, beliefs, attitudes, religions, or life focus but also different viewpoints regarding intellectual property. As a result, companies intending to outsource services or production must carefully choose outsourcing locations, considering numerous different factors, such as English proficiency, salaries, or geopolitical risk. While countries such as India remain popular, other formerly popular countries (such as Singapore, Canada, or Ireland) are declining because of rising salaries. With these shifts, outsourcers are constantly looking at nascent and emerging countries such as Bulgaria, Egypt, Ghana, Bangladesh, or Vietnam.

Obviously, organizations must weigh the potential benefits (e.g., cost savings) and drawbacks (e.g., higher geopolitical risk or less experienced workers) of outsourcing to a particular country, and often, cost savings prove to be negligible due to added overhead, such as customs, shipping, or training as well as quality problems. In fact, InformationWeek , a leading publication targeting business IT users, found that 20 percent of the 500 most innovative companies in terms of using IT took back projects previously outsourced to another country. Nevertheless, IT outsourcing is big business, with an estimated market size of US$85.6 billion in 2018 (Kachkovska, 2019).

SOCIETAL ISSUES IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. The rapid development of transportation and telecommunication technologies, national and global infrastructures, and information systems as well as a host of other factors has created a number of pressing societal issues that will tremendously influence the world we live in (PWC, 2020; Schreiber, 2018). In this section, we will highlight a few of these issues (Figure 1.5). One such issue is demographic changes -changes in the structure of populations related to factors such as age, birth rates, and migration. While many countries in the developed world see rapidly aging populations, developing regions such as Africa are expected to rapidly rise in population, fueling a massive global population growth. These differences in demographic changes will also shift the balance of demand and supply of labor; further, differences in welfare are likely to continue to increase, and many countries are already experiencing both positive and negative effects of mass migrations. In addition, many regions of the world are seeing rapid urbanization -the movement of rural populations to urban areas, to a point where 50 percent of the world's population is now living in cities (PWC, 2020); sustaining this growth while providing livable environments for the inhabitants will pose major challenges. Another major trend is the global shifts in economic power -changes in countries' purchasing power and control over natural resources-where established economies are losing their dominating positions in the world's economy, resulting

in the need to resolve political struggles (PWC, 2020). Many of these issues interact, affect each other, and/or fuel other issues, such as those related to resource scarcity due to limited availability of fossil fuels and other natural resources and climate change -large-scale and long-term regional and global changes in temperatures and weather patterns. Population growth, global trade, consumerism, and other factors contribute to increasing waste and pollution, as well as a growing need for resources at a time where humans already live beyond the finite natural resources the planet can provide. Likewise, climate change-regardless of its causes-and its associated changes in weather patterns, rise in sea levels, and increase in the severity of storms pose many challenges for individuals, societies, and the world. As a consequence, sustainable development -'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)-will become an increasingly important aspect. In addition to these societal issues, we have witnessed a number of breakthroughs and transformations enabled by technology; these breakthroughs are disrupting traditional business models (e.g., as Uber has wreaked havoc on the taxi industry) but can also help address pressing societal issues. Next, we will discuss how increasing digital density shapes the digital future.

## Digital Density and the Digital Future

In  most  developed  societies,  information  technologies  have  become  pervasive-information technologies are in fact used throughout society, and the speed of innovations is increasing at a tremendous pace, with many radical innovations marginalizing or displacing existing products or industries (see Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems'). For example, within just a few years, drones evolved from being primarily used by the military to being used by farmers, aerial photographers, filmmakers, and hobbyists alike. Self-parking systems are already available in many vehicles, self-driving cars and trucks are being actively tested by various companies, and autonomous Caterpillar mining trucks are already in use. Likewise, the development of sophisticated web technologies has brought about a fundamental shift in types of information technologies that are being used. In essence, we are seeing an exponential increase  in digital  density (i.e.,  the  amount  of  connected  data  per  unit  of  activity)  (Zamora, 2017), in that every unit of activity generates ever more connected data, enabling new valueadded interactions and business models (Figure 1.6).

THE DRIVERS OF DIGITAL DENSITY. Understanding the effects of increasing digital density will be increasingly important: Individuals will increasingly feel the impact on their private and work lives, and businesses need to have a business strategy that is fit for today's digital world and the digital future. Next, we will discuss connections and data, the essential drivers of digital density.

Connections. In the past, connections were between people, between organizations, or between computers; today, it is possible to connect just about any element of the physical world-people, organizations, or things-to the digital realm (Zamora, 2017). A key enabler of increasing connections is the move toward mobile devices, as indicated in the opening section of this chapter. In developed countries, most adults have a mobile phone, and typically, people have their mobile phones within their reach 24/7. Compare that with the access to your laptop or PC. In the developing world, mobile devices are frequently seen leapfrogging traditional PCs; owing

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Technology (Not) Included

With increasing digital density in all aspects of our lives, there is one core element that we increasingly tend to take for  granted-access to technology. The threat of the COVID-19 pandemic showed us all that this requirement is not a given. Besides the obvious health and economic consequences from shutting down the world to limit the spread of disease, other technology-related consequences manifested because of the digital divide. Across the world, less than 55 percent of the population has internet access, and in the U.S., households earning less than US$30,000 are much less likely to have access than wealthier families. Yet increasingly, technology is required to engage in today's workforce, work from home, and have access to education. How can an employee be expected to work remotely if they do not own a personal computer or have access to broadband? How can our children participate in remote learning? In some cases, employers issue technology resources to address these questions about access, but that is certainly not guaranteed. Regarding remote learning, some school districts have the financial resources to provide children with computers, but families again face the issue of being able to afford internet access.

interact with their physicians without unnecessary exposure to contagion for either the patient or the medical provider. Therefore, it is not surprising that underserved communities, already suffering from a digital divide, see that divide further manifest in difficulty accessing healthcare. According to Cleveland, Ohio physician Dr. Harwell, 'when you need telemedicine everywhere, you see a vulnerable population that doesn't have the means to use it.' Patients struggle with assumed simple tasks like using Wi-Fi or joining a Zoom session. So, the question remains, how do we as a society bridge the digital divide before the next inevitable pandemic?

Besides lack of or limited daily access to technology for creating the connections and data required for digital density, less obvious consequences arise regarding routine healthcare visits. Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 require the implementation of social distancing and isolation measures. With social distancing comes a rise in telemedicine so that patients can

For organizations, this increase in mobility has a wide range of implications, from increased collaboration to the ability to manage a business in real time-at any time, from anywhere-to changes in the way new (or existing) customers can be reached (  Figure   1.  7  ). For organizations, it is now essential to create mobile-devicefriendly versions of their websites or mobile apps (software programs designed to perform a particular, well-defined function) to market their products or services; customers' interactions with companies happen less during well-defined sessions using a laptop or desktop PC, but rather are increasingly driven by micro-moments , during which a person almost instinctively picks up a mobile device to accomplish a particular goal-to buy something, know something, do something, or go somewhere. In addition, fueled by advances in consumer-oriented mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) and the ability to access data and applications 'in the cloud,' today's employees are increasingly using their own devices for work-related purposes or are using software they are used to (such as social networks for communicating) in the workplace. While initially workers tended to use their own devices primarily for checking email or visiting social networking sites, they now use their own devices for various other important tasks, including customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning. For organizations, this trend can be worrying (due to concerns related to security or compliance or increasing need to support the workers' own devices), but it can also provide a host of opportunities, such as increased productivity, higher retention rates of talented employees, or higher customer satisfaction. Managing this trend of 'bring your own device' ( BYOD ) is clearly a major concern

of business and IT managers alike. Further, we have witnessed the consumerization of IT ; many technological innovations are first introduced in the consumer marketplace before being used by organizations, and businesses must constantly evaluate how a wide variety of new technologies might influence their ways of doing business. Throughout the text, we will introduce issues and new developments associated with increases in mobility.

In addition to an increase in mobile devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) -a network of a broad range of physical objects that can automatically share data over the internet-is a key factor in increasing digital density. Such objects (or 'things') can range from an automobile tire equipped with a pressure sensor to a smart meter enabling remote monitoring of energy consumption to a cow with an injectable ID chip. Already in 2008, more devices were connected to the internet than there were people living on earth. Fueled by advances in chips and wireless radios and decreasing costs of sensors (devices that can detect, record, and report changes in the physical environment), in the not-too-distant future everything that can generate useful information will be equipped with sensors and wireless radios to connect to other devices or the cloud (Figure 1.8). In other words, anything that can generate data or uses data can be connected, accessed, or controlled via the internet (sometimes referred to as 'pervasive computing'). With the ability to connect 'things' such as sensors, meters, signals, motors, actuators, or cameras, the potential for gathering useful data is almost limitless. For example, the market for smart home technologies (sometimes called home automation )-technologies enabling the remote monitoring and controlling of lighting, heating, or home appliances such as the Nest Learning Thermostat-is expected to reach almost US$140 billion by 2023. Wearable technologies -clothing or accessories that incorporate electronic technologies, such as the Apple Watch, Samsung's Galaxy Gear, or the Fitbit-incorporate various sensors; depending on the device, the sensors record physiological data such as body movements or heart rate but also environmental data such as ambient light, orientation, or altitude. Smartwatches such as the Apple Watch or Samsung's Galaxy Gear are designed to be an extension of the user's phones, used to display notifications from the phone or tablet devices, providing quick access to some of the phone's or tablet's functions, in addition to enabling the user to monitor various fitness activities. Activity trackers such as the Fitbit are designed to be worn and passively used on a regular basis, supporting the ' quantified self '-the logging of all aspects of one's daily life, ranging from monitoring and recording of activities, performance, or intakes to monitoring bodily states (such as moods or physiological data) to improve one's overall health and performance. Cardiac monitors can alert physicians of patients' health risks. In public spaces, sensors integrated in a road's surface can monitor temperatures and trigger dynamic speed limits in case there is the risk of ice or

snow. Similarly, sensors can monitor availability of parking spaces or traffic flow, alerting drivers of changes in conditions. Millions of sensors connected to the internet can monitor weather conditions, helping to generate more accurate local weather predictions, or can monitor soil moisture in golf courses, reducing the need for watering. The use of IoT technologies in manufacturing-referred to as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) -enables the convergence of information technology and operations technology, offering the potential for tremendous improvements in efficiency, product quality, agility, and flexibility, allowing companies to massproduce customized products, better monitor supply chains, and so on. In sum, the applications of sensor technology for home automation, smart cities, smart metering, smart farming, e-health, manufacturing, and other areas are almost limitless. As the number of sensors and devices connected to the internet grows, the Internet of Things will evolve to become the Internet of Everything (IoE), where just about any device's functionality is enhanced through connectivity and intelligence.

Data. The ability to connect elements of the physical to the digital world has generated tremendous amounts of Big Data . Big Data is typically described as extremely large and complex datasets, which are characterized as being of high volume, variety (i.e., many different types of data), and velocity (i.e., the data are being collected and analyzed at ever-increasing rates). Following the old adage that information is power, organizations are continuously seeking to get the right information to make the best business decisions and are generating and collecting ever more data from internal and external sources. In addition, the rise of social media has further increased the amount of unstructured data available to organizations; for example, people frequently voice their thoughts about products or companies on blogs or social networks. With decreasing costs for capturing and storing data, data are now not only ubiquitous but also cheap, with many organizations using cloud computing (see Chapter 3, 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services') to store data and maintain their information systems infrastructure. Further, cloud computing can enable advanced analytics of massive amounts of Big Data generated by mobile devices, sensors, or users of social networks. A study by research

firm IDC estimated that by 2025, the world's data will have grown to 175 zettabytes. How much is 175 zettabytes? Well, 175 zettabytes equal 175 trillion gigabytes, or the equivalent of 350 billion 512GB iPads.

Interactions. Together, increasing connections and data enable new value-added interactions and business models. For many organizations today, value is created from data. Consider, for example, that the largest/most valuable organizations in the 'old economy' (such as GE, Dow, or Ford) have 100,000-300,000 employees, and the largest organizations in the 'new economy' (such as Microsoft, HP, or Oracle) have 50,000-100,000 employees; in contrast, modern companies of the digital world (such as Airbnb, Facebook, or Twitter) have risen to the top with a mere 5,000-15,000 employees by creating value from data (Hofmann, 2011) (Figure 1.9). Ever-increasing amounts of data increase the ability to detect meaningful relationships and regularities, and insights gained from analyzing Big Data not only can contribute to business success but can also help to address some of the tremendous challenges society faces. For example, Big Data is a key factor enabling research ranging from genomics to climate change. However, analyzing enormous amounts of (often unstructured) data (i.e., Big Data) poses tremendous challenges for organizations.

Continuous input from various sensors, paired with artificial intelligence (AI; i.e., using information technologies to simulate human intelligence) to make sense of such Big Data streams, enables advances in robotics (i.e., the use of robots to perform manual tasks). The increase of connections and data has also enabled various business model innovations that disrupt established industries, and connected data has become a core aspect of many organizations' business models. For example, benefiting from the network effect -referring to the notion that the value of a network (or tool or application based on a network) increases with the number of other users-Uber and Airbnb are examples of innovative business models that disrupt traditional industries. Likewise, the Internet of Things and the massive amounts of data generated enable the creation of service-oriented business models (sometimes referred to servitization ), where companies shift from selling physical products to providing these as services (see Chapter 2); for example, using sensors to monitor performance, temperature, or mileage enables tire manufacturers Bridgestone and Michelin to sell tires as a service, where truck operators pay based on usage, whereas the manufacturer is responsible for the tires' performance. Other industries being disrupted range from the financial industry to healthcare providers, where information systems allow for various radical innovations. Whereas traditionally, data and information systems were used primarily to enhance efficiency, increasingly connected data allow for anticipating changes, improving coordination of resources, and personalizing product or service offerings (Zamora, 2017).

THE API ECONOMY. One of the key drivers of continuous innovations and new business models has been the rise of APIs (application programming interfaces) , which are intermediaries that provide ways for different components of software to interact and exchange data or functionality using common web communication protocols. Through APIs, a website or service provider can make parts of its functionality or data available for others to use without the need for users

to have intimate knowledge about the provider's inner workings. Think of an API just like a power socket in your home or apartment. The power socket is an interface that allows you to receive services (electricity) from a service provider (the electric utility); the power socket has a standardized format in terms of the input (i.e., the plug format) and output (the voltage and frequency). As a service user, you do not need to know how the electricity is produced or how it is delivered to you so that you can charge your smartphone.

The business value of APIs is twofold: Organizations providing the APIs can create new revenue streams and increase the accessibility of its services, whereas users of the APIs can utilize the functionality to offer value-added services. APIs have become both commonplace and important in today's digital interactions, such that some argue that we are in an 'API economy.' In fact, the cloud services company Akamai estimated that whereas in 2014, API traffic had accounted for 47 percent of all data traffic, in 2018, this had jumped to 83 percent with HTML (website) traffic having only accounted for 17 percent One example of a successful company using APIs is the payment platform Stripe, which handles online payments for companies ranging from Target to Lyft. Stripe processes payments using its highly reliable and secure internal systems and makes these payment processing services available to others through a variety of APIs. Companies such as Lyft can connect their system to Stripe's API and focus on their core competencies while making payments appear seamless. If Stripe needs to make any changes to its internal systems, this happens behind the scenes, such that the API remains unchanged, and the API users typically will not even notice that anything has changed. The use of APIs has enabled Stripe to quickly expand and to become one of the most successful payment processing services.

Likewise, Lyft uses Google Map's API to integrate mapping functionality into their app to visualize riders and available vehicles. The proliferation of APIs has enabled numerous successful startups, who draw on various APIs to scale quickly and provide innovative services to their customers; as building an entire app would have taken too long to build, Uber built almost their entire app around APIs provided by other companies (further, it would have been close to impossible to develop functionality that matches Google's mapping services). The use of APIs, however, is not limited to startups. Traditional companies make heavy use of APIs to extend their service offerings. For example, Expedia offers APIs allowing hotels to connect to Expedia's systems, and banks use APIs to collaborate with fintech startups to provide value-added services or to allow organizations to connect their information systems to the bank and access a variety of transaction data or process transactions. Together, the use of APIs enables companies to focus on what they do best, while drawing on services and functionalities offered by others.

DIGITAL DENSITY AND TODAY'S WORKFORCE. While increasing digital density opens up an almost unlimited potential for innovative products, services, or processes, it also poses a variety of challenges for organizations operating in the digital world. Throughout the book, we will discuss not only the opportunities but also the challenges organizations face when trying to harness the potential of increasing digital density. What does increasing digital density mean for you and for today's workforce? On a most basic level, they imply that being able to use information systems, to assess the impacts of new technologies on one's work or private life, and to learn new technologies as they come along will be increasingly important skills.

Most modern-day high school and university students have grown up in a computerized world. If, by some chance, they do not know how to operate a computer by the time they graduate from high school, they soon acquire computer skills because in today's work world, knowing how to use a computer-called computer literacy (or information literacy)-can not only open up myriad sources of information but can also mean the difference between being employed and being unemployed. In fact, some fear that the Information Age will not provide the same advantages to 'information haves'-those computer-literate individuals who have almost unlimited access to information-and 'information have-nots'-those with limited or no computer access or skills.

Computer-related occupations have evolved as computers have become more sophisticated and more widely used. Where once we thought of computer workers as primarily programmers, data entry clerks, systems analysts, or computer repairpersons, today many more job categories in virtually all industries, from accounting to the medical field, involve the use of computers. In fact, today there are few occupations where computers are not somehow in use. Information systems are used to manage air traffic, perform medical tests, monitor investment portfolios, control construction machinery, and more.

## GREEN IT

## The Green Internet of Things

The internet and associated technologies have been busy disrupting business and society for the past several decades. Next up, another revolution in information technology is going to shake things up again. green IT (or green computing  , see   Chapter   3  ) refers to the study and practice of using computing resources more efficiently to reduce environmental impacts as well as the use of information systems to reduce negative environmental impacts. The Internet of Things brings connectivity and information technology to places never before considered. Together, these technologies are once again poised to revolutionize business and society.

Traditionally, IT resources were seen as an ever-expanding pool-as business needs grew, more servers and data centers were installed. Eventually, a limit is reached; the impact of power consumption alone from a modern data center can be profound. New technologies and techniques are having a large impact on both how we provision IT resources and how we interact with our world's resources. Not only are new computing resources designed for low power consumption, but cloud computing architectures allow resources to be allocated on an as-needed basis.

the real world. Umbrellas notify us of the weather, smartwatches monitor our steps and vital signs, and nano-scale sensors are helping scientists collect unprecedented data about natural phenomena and ecosystems. Farmers know exactly how much water, sun, and fertilizer their crops have received, and power companies can instrument our houses, our cars, and their distribution systems to gain unprecedented insights into energy use and demand.

Internet technologies disrupted many businesses and social processes by changing the scope and scale of interactions between people. By making large-scale interaction and communication possible almost instantaneously, supply chains could be redesigned, globalization was accelerated, and political processes were altered (for better and for worse). Individuals became citizen journalists. Together with the IoT, green technologies are enabling more accurate forecasting of resource needs and allow businesses and governments alike to become more informed and responsive. Tomorrow's leaders will need to incorporate such devices and systems into their planning to stay ahead of customer and citizen wants and needs.

With the internet maturing into an established platform, new opportunities have become apparent. By combining ubiquitous connectivity with inexpensive processing power and sensor devices, nearly anything can be connected to the internet. To be considered a part of the IoT, a device simply needs to be connected to the internet, collect and transmit sensory data, and be something physical that interacts with

Not only do we use information systems at work, we also use them in our personal lives. We teach our children on them, manage our finances, do our taxes, compose letters and term papers, create greeting cards, send and receive email, surf the internet, purchase products, and play games on them. With the increasing use of information systems in all areas of society, many argue that being computer literate-knowing how to use a computer and use certain applications-is not sufficient in today's world; rather, computer   fluency -the ability to independently learn new technologies as they emerge and assess their impact on one's work and life-is what will set you apart in the future.

## Information Systems Defined

An information system (IS) is the combination of people and information technology that create,  collect,  process,  store,  and  distribute  useful  data. Information  technology  (IT) includes hardware , software ,  and telecommunications  networks .  Hardware  refers  to physical computer equipment, such as a computer, tablet, or printer, as well as components like a computer monitor or keyboard. Software refers to a program or set of programs that

<!-- image -->

tell the computer to perform certain tasks. Telecommunications networks refer to a group of two or more computer systems linked together with communications equipment. Although we discuss the  design,  implementation,  use,  and  implications  of  hardware,  software,  and telecommunications throughout the text, the specifics on hardware, software, and telecommunications networks are discussed in Chapter 3 and the Technology Briefing. While traditionally the term information technology referred to the hardware, software, and networking components of an information system, the difference is shrinking, with many using the terms IS and IT synonymously. It is  important  to  note  that  while  many  of  today's  technologies operate autonomously, they do not build themselves and do not exist for their own sake; rather, they are created to serve a useful purpose for people. Also, any information system involves data that are useful, for someone, somewhere. For example, transactional data are useful  for  businesses,  status  updates  in  your  news  feed  on  Facebook  are  useful  for  your friends as well as for Facebook itself, scores in a computer game are useful for the player as well as for the game developers, and so on. In Figure 1.10, we show the relationships among these IS components.

People in organizations use information systems to process sales transactions, manage loan applications, or help financial analysts decide where, when, and how to invest. Product managers also use them to help decide where, when, and how to market their products and related services, and production managers use them to help decide when and how to manufacture products. Information systems also enable us to get cash from ATMs, communicate by live video with people in other parts of the world, or buy concert or airline tickets. (Note that the term information systems is also used to describe the field comprising people who develop, use, manage, and study information systems in organizations.)

It is important to note that people use various terms to describe the field of information systems, such as management information systems, business information systems, computer information systems , and simply systems . Next, we more thoroughly examine the key components of the IS definition.

## Data: The Root and Purpose of Information Systems

Earlier, we defined information systems as the combination of people and information technology that create, collect, process, store, and distribute useful data. We begin by talking about data, the most basic element of any information system.

DATA. Before you can understand how information systems work, it is important to distinguish between raw, unformatted data, information, and knowledge. Unformatted data, or simply data , are raw symbols, such as characters and numbers. Data have no meaning in and of themselves and are of little value until processed (Ackoff, 1989). For example, if we asked you what 465889727 meant or stood for, you could not tell us (Figure 1.11). However, if we presented the same data as 465-88-9727 and told you it was located in a certain database, in John Doe's record, in a field labeled SSN , you might rightly surmise that the number was actually the Social Security number of someone named John Doe. While data have no inherent meaning, the old adage 'garbage in, garbage out' applies to data as well; thus, a key consideration of assessing whether data are reliable for making decisions is data quality , consisting of completeness, accuracy, timeliness, validity, and consistency.

INFORMATION. Data can be formatted, organized, or processed to make them useful ; they are transformed into information , which can be defined as a representation of reality, and can help to answer questions about who, what, where, and when (Ackoff, 1989). In the previous example, 465-88-9727 was used to represent and identify an individual person, John Doe (see Figure 1.11). Contextual cues, such as a label, are needed to turn data into information that is familiar and useful to the reader. Think about your experience with ATMs. A list of all the transactions at a bank's ATMs over the course of a month would be fairly useless data. However, a table that divided ATM users into two categories, bank customers and non-bank customers, and compared the two groups' use of the machine-their purpose for using the ATMs and the times and days on which they use them-would be incredibly useful information. A bank manager could use this information to create marketing mailings to attract new customers. Without information systems, it would be difficult to transform raw data into useful information.

KNOWLEDGE. To actually use information, knowledge is needed. Knowledge is the ability to understand information, form opinions, and make decisions or predictions based on the information. For example, you must have knowledge to be aware that only one Social Security number can uniquely identify each individual (see Figure 1.11). Knowledge is a body of governing procedures, such as guidelines or rules, that are used to organize or manipulate data to make them suitable for a given task.

Understanding the distinctions between data, information, and knowledge is important because all are used in the study, development, and use of information systems.

## Hardware, Software, and Telecommunications Networks: The Components of Information Systems

Ever since the dawn of humankind, there was a need to transform data into useful information for people, and people have invented various calculating devices, such as the abacus or the slide rule. Before the introduction of the first computers (which worked on a mechanical basis using punch cards), almost all business and government information systems consisted of file folders, filing cabinets, and document repositories. Computer hardware has replaced these physical artifacts, providing the technologies to input and process data and output useful information; today,

hardware includes not only 'traditional' computer components but a variety of other input and output devices, including sensors, cameras, actuators, and the like. Software enables organizations to utilize the hardware to execute their business processes and competitive strategy by providing the computer hardware with instructions on what processing functions to perform. Finally, the telecommunications networks allow computers to share data and services, enabling the global collaboration, communication, and commerce we see today. The rapid evolution of the various hardware, software, and networking components make the ability to tie everything together ever more important.

## People: The Builders, Managers, and Users of Information Systems

The IS field  includes  a  vast  collection  of  people  who  develop,  maintain,  manage,  and  study information systems. Yet an information system does not exist in a vacuum and is of little use if it weren't for you-the user. We will begin by discussing the IS profession and then talk about why knowing about fundamental concepts of information systems is of crucial importance in your personal and professional life.

If you are choosing a career in the IS field, you will find countless opportunities. With the growing value of data for competitive advantage, every company can now be considered a technology company, needing people with the right skill set to help optimize its business processes and discover new ways of using information systems for gaining competitive advantage. The career opportunities for a person with IS training continue to be strong, and they are expected to continue to improve over the next 10 years. For example, the Occupational Outlook Handbook published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020a) predicted that employment for computer and IS managers will grow 11 percent through 2028, much faster than the average for all other occupations (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/computerand-information-systems-managers.htm). As more and more organizations rely increasingly heavily on IS professionals, this boost in employment will occur in nearly every industry, not just computer hardware and software companies. Among the 50 best jobs in America ranked by the job site Glassdoor, six of the top ten jobs (and one third of the top jobs overall) were IS related (see Table 1.1). Money magazine (http://money.cnn.com/pf/best-jobs) ranked mobile app developer as the best job in America, with information assurance analyst and data analyst also being among the top 10 best jobs in America; U.S. News magazine (http://money.usnews .com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs) rated software developer and IT manager among the top 20 jobs as well as the data science-related jobs statistician, mathematician, and operations research analyst (together, these are the only nonmedical jobs in that list).

Likewise, a degree in information systems can provide the foundation for becoming a data scientist, currently one of the jobs with highest demand (Heltzel, 2019). Whereas the rankings differ, it is clear that many professions related to data and information systems remain in high demand and will likely do so for the foreseeable future.

In addition to an ample supply of jobs, earnings for IS professionals will remain strong. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020b), median annual earnings of these managers in May 2019 were US$146,360, with the top 10 percent earning more than US$208,000. Also, according to Salary.com, the median salary in 2020 for IT managers was US$122,220. According to a 2019 report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, management information systems was expected to be the highest-paid business major, with a mean starting salary of US$61,697. Likewise, information systems graduates with a master's degree had an average starting salary of US$84,113, higher than business majors such as accounting, finance, or marketing, according to a study by the Association for Information Systems and Institute for Business and Information Technology at Temple University. Finally, computer and IS managers, especially those at higher levels, often receive more employment-related benefits-such as expense accounts, stock option plans, and bonuses-than do nonmanagerial workers in their organizations (a study by Payscale.com found that IS majors were-post-graduation-among the most satisfied with their careers).

As you can see, there continues to be a very strong need for people with IS knowledge, skills, and abilities-in particular, people with advanced IS skills, as we describe here. In fact, IS careers are regularly selected as not only one of the fastest growing but also a career with far-above-average opportunities for greater personal growth, stability, and advancement. Although technology continues to become easier to use, there is still and is likely to continue to be an acute need for people within the organization who have the responsibility of planning for, designing, developing, maintaining, and managing technologies. Much of this will happen within the business units and will be done by those with primarily business duties and tasks as opposed to systems duties and tasks. However, we are a long way from the day when technology is so easy to deploy that a need no longer exists for people with advanced IS knowledge and skills. In fact, many people believe that this day may never come. Although increasing numbers of people will incorporate systems responsibilities within their nonsystems jobs, there will continue to be a need for people with primarily systems responsibilities. In short, IS staffs and departments will likely continue to exist and play an important role in the foreseeable future.

Given that information systems continue to be a critical tool for business success, it is not likely that IS departments will go away or even shrink significantly. Indeed, all projections are for long-term growth of information systems in both scale and scope. Also, as is the case in any area of business, those people who are continually learning, continuing to grow, and continuing to find new ways to add value and who have advanced and/or unique skills will always be sought after, whether in information systems or in any area of the firm.

The future opportunities in the IS field are likely to be found in a variety of areas, which is good news for everyone. Diversity in the technology area can embrace us all. It really does not matter much which area of information systems you choose to pursue-there will likely be a promising future there for you. Even if your career interests are outside information systems, being a well-informed and capable user of information technologies will greatly enhance your career prospects.

CAREERS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS. The field of information systems includes those people in organizations who design and build systems, those who use these systems, and those responsible for managing these systems. The people who help develop and manage systems in organizations include systems analysts, systems programmers, systems operators, network administrators, database administrators, systems designers, systems managers, and chief information officers. (In Table 1.2 we describe some of these careers.) This list is not exhaustive; rather, it is intended to provide a sampling of IS management positions. Furthermore, many firms will use the same job title, but each is likely to define it in a different way, or different companies will have different titles for the same basic function. As you can see from Table 1.2, the range of career opportunities for IS managers is broad, and salary expectations are high.

WHAT MAKES IS PERSONNEL SO VALUABLE? In addition to the growing importance of people in the IS field, there have been changes in the nature of this type of work. No longer are IS departments in organizations filled only with nerdy men with pocket protectors. Many more women are in IS positions now. Also, it is now more common for an IS professional to be a polished, professional businessperson who can speak fluently about both business and technology. IS personnel are now well-trained, highly skilled, valuable professionals who garner high wages and prestige and who play a pivotal role in helping firms be successful.

Many studies have been aimed at helping us understand what knowledge and skills are necessary for a person in the IS area to be successful. Interestingly, these studies also point out just what it is about IS personnel that makes them so valuable to their organizations. In a nutshell, good IS personnel possess valuable, integrated knowledge and skills in three areas-technical, business, and systems-as outlined in Table 1.3 (see also Figure 1.12).

Technical Competency The technical competency area includes knowledge and skills in hardware, software, networking, and security. In a sense, this is the 'nuts and bolts' of information systems. This is not to say that the IS professional must be a technical expert in these areas. On the contrary, the IS professional must know just enough about these areas to understand how they work, what they can do for an organization, and how they can and should be applied. Typically, the IS professional manages or directs those who have deeper, more detailed technical knowledge.

The technical area of competency is, perhaps, the most difficult to maintain because of the rapid pace of technological innovation in the digital world. With the rapid evolution of new business models, existing organizations are starting new projects and new startups start and scale their businesses; hence, while it once appeared as if most programming jobs or support jobs would be outsourced to third-party providers abroad, there is an increased demand in many companies for people with application development skills, especially in combination with sound business analysis and project management skills. In fact, many of the hot skills listed in Table 1.4 are focused on the business domain, which is discussed next.

Business Competency The business competency area is one that sets the IS professional apart from others who have only technical knowledge and skills, and in an era of increased outsourcing, it may well save a person's job. For example, even though some low-level technology jobs may be outsourced, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020a) recently reported that there is an increased need for IS managers as organizations embrace mobility and cloud computing (https:// www.bls.gov/ooh/management/computer-and-information-systems-managers.htm). As a result, it is absolutely vital for IS professionals to understand the technical areas and the nature of the business. IS professionals must also be able to understand and manage people and projects, not just the technology. These business skills propel IS professionals into project management and, ultimately, high-paying middle- and upper-level management positions.

Systems Competency Systems competency is another area that sets the IS professional apart from others with only technical knowledge and skills. Those who understand how to build and integrate systems and how to solve problems will ultimately manage large, complex systems projects as well as manage those in the firm who have only technical knowledge and skills.

Perhaps now you can see why IS professionals are so valuable to their organizations. These individuals have a solid, integrated foundation in technical, business, and systems knowledge and skills. Perhaps most important, they also have the social skills to understand how to work well with and motivate others. It is these core competencies that continue to make IS professionals valuable employees.

Given how important technology is, what does this mean for your career? Technology is being used to radically change how business is conducted-from the way products and services are produced, distributed, and accounted for to the ways they are marketed and sold. Whether you are majoring in information systems, finance, accounting, operations management, human resource management, business law, or marketing, knowledge of technology is critical to a successful career in business.

FINDING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. Unfortunately, given the increased sophistication of modern information systems, organizations can often have a difficult time finding qualified personnel, and attracting the right people with the right skills is not possible in some areas. Consequently, many technology-focused organizations tend to cluster in areas where talented workers are available. Such areas are often characterized by a high quality of life for the people living there, and it is no surprise that many companies in the IT sector within the United States are headquartered in Silicon Valley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Austin, Texas; or Seattle, Washington. With increasing globalization, other regions throughout the world are boasting about their highly skilled personnel. One such example is the Indian city of Bangalore, where, more than a century ago, Maharajas started to lure talented technology-oriented people to the region, building a world-class human resource infrastructure that attracted companies from around the world. In other areas, organizations may have to find creative ways to attract and retain people, such as by offering favorable benefits packages that include educational grants or expense-matching programs to encourage employees to improve their education and skills. Other human resource policies, such as telecommuting, flextime, and creative benefit packages, can also help to attract and retain the best employees.

YOU-THE USER. Clearly, the field of information systems offers a wide variety of interesting career choices, and you will likely find a career that offers a host of opportunities for lifelong learning and advancement. Yet understanding fundamental concepts related to information systems will be critical in almost any career as well as in your private life. In almost any business-related field, you will be extensively using information systems, and you will likely be involved in various information

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Ransomware

As more and more of our personal and professional lives are lived online, the security of our personal and business data has become increasingly important. In recent years, attackers have gotten more sophisticated and have shifted tactics. A new tactic is the distribution of ransomware, a novel approach to extracting money from victims. Ransomware refers to a type of virus that, once it has infected a victim's system or network, encrypts the data it finds in place in a format that renders them impossible for the victim to access. The attacker then demands a ransom payment in return for releasing the decryption keys that can be used to access and recover the data (though many victims have painfully experienced that paying the ransom does not guarantee regaining access to the data). Victims range from individuals, who may stand to lose years of family photos or personal records, to businesses large and small, who may lose customer records, financial data, intellectual property, or other valuable data. The malicious software usually arrives as an attachment to a spam email or is downloaded in the guise of a video or other content from a website.

Until recently, attackers have largely focused on individuals and small businesses and demanded relatively small ransoms that are affordable enough that the victim will seriously consider paying the ransom. The average payment demanded in 2018 was just US$530 according to researchers, with an upper limit of about US$1,000. However, there has been a shift to larger, higher-value companies, government agencies, and organizations, to fuel the multi-hundred million US dollar criminal enterprise. The School of Medicine at University of

California, San Francisco was forced to pay a US$1.14 million ransom after its network was broadly infected with ransomware in mid-2020. Additionally, ransom amounts demanded from the healthcare industry, specifically, have ranged between US$1,600 and US$14 million. Security researchers warn that attackers are increasingly not just attempting to lock down the data but are threatening to release the data to the public if not paid. For organizations dealing with sensitive or personally identifiable information, lawsuits and reporting requirements can make such public release an even more costly threat than simply losing access to their data.

With threats like ransomware becoming increasingly prevalent, individuals and organizations will need to increase their security awareness and vigilance to better avoid potential infections and also improve their backup and disaster recovery preparations to become more resilient to such attacks.

systems-related decisions within your organization. Understanding what information systems are capable of doing (as well as what they cannot do), being able to communicate with the 'techies,' and being able to make educated IS-related decisions are likely to set you apart from your competition. Especially in smaller organizations (that may not have dedicated IS departments), you are likely to be involved in IS-related investment decisions, and lacking a basic understanding of fundamental issues associated with topics such as IS infrastructure, systems analysis and design, or information systems security will put you at the mercy of outside consultants or (worse yet) vendors who are likely to act out of their own interests, often trying to sell you their 'technology of the week/month/year.'

In addition, as you have undoubtedly noticed, you are facing various IS-related decisions in your private life. Examples of such decisions abound; for example, you may face the question of what mobile phone to purchase next: an iPhone, a phone using some version of the Android operating system, or a phone sporting the Tizen operating system. Such decisions are likely to include your own preferences or influence by your peers, but there are a few critical differences in terms of privacy, security, available apps, and the like. Likewise, you may face the problem of how to best secure your wireless network at home or may wonder how to best keep your various files in sync across different computers or mobile devices.

Finally, you may have a great idea for a new product or service and want to launch a startup. Having the idea is but the first step, and you will soon realize the role of information systems in all phases of the process of bringing your idea to the market. Thus, understanding how information systems can fuel the development and commercialization of your idea is crucial. Throughout this text, we will touch on those issues and hope that you will gain valuable knowledge to understand the trade-offs involved when selecting new information systems.

## Organizations: The Context of Information Systems

We have talked about data versus information, the technology side of information systems, and the people side of information systems. Information systems do not exist in a vacuum; they are built and/or used within a certain context. Organizations use information systems to become more productive and profitable, to gain competitive advantage, to reach more customers, or to improve customer service. This holds true for all types of organizations-professional, social, religious, educational, and governmental-and for all types of industries-medical, legal, manufacturing, and so on. In fact, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service launched its own website for the reasons just described (Figure 1.13). The website was so popular that approximately 220,000 users visited it

during the first 24 hours and more than 1 million visited it in its first week-even before the web address for the site was officially announced. Today, popular websites like Facebook.com and WSJ.com receive millions of visitors every day.

TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS. Throughout this text, we explore various types of information systems commonly used in organizations. It makes sense, however, for us to describe briefly a few of the various types of systems used so that you will better understand what we mean by the term information system as we use it throughout the rest of the book. Table 1.5 provides a list of the major categories of information systems used in organizations.

TABLE 1.5 Categories of Information Systems Used in Organizations

Topping the list in the table are some of the more traditional, major categories that are used to describe information systems. For example, not only are transaction processing systems (TPS) used by a broad range of organizations to process customer transactions more efficiently, these systems also generate a tremendous amount of data that can be used by the organization to learn about customers or ever-changing product trends. Your local grocery store uses a TPS at the checkout that scans bar codes on products; as this occurs, many stores will print discount coupons on the backs of receipts for products related to current purchases. Every hour, online retailer Amazon's website processes thousands of transactions from around the world. This massive amount of data is fed into large data warehouses and is then analyzed to provide purchase recommendations to future customers. In addition, TPS data are sorted and organized to support a broad range of managerial decision making using a variety of systems; the most common of these is generally referred to as management information systems . TPS data also provide input into a variety of other information systems within organizations, including decision support systems, intelligent systems, business intelligence systems, knowledge management systems, social software, geographic information systems , and functional area information systems . Ten to fifteen years ago, it would have been typical to see systems that fell cleanly into one of these categories. Today, many organizations have replaced standalone systems with enterprise systems that span the entire organization. Likewise, with internetworking -connecting host computers and their networks together to form even larger networks like the internet-and systems integration -connecting separate information systems and data to improve business processes and decision making-it is difficult to say that any given information system fits into only one of these categories (e.g., that a system is a management information system only and nothing else). In addition, many of these systems are not housed within organizations anymore but are located 'in the cloud' and accessed via the users' browsers when needed. Modern-day information systems tend to span several of these categories of information systems, helping not only to collect data from throughout the firm and from customers but also to integrate data from diverse sources and present them to busy decision makers along with tools to manipulate and analyze those data. Customer relationship management, supply chain management , and enterprise resource planning systems are good examples of these types of systems that encompass many features and types of data and cannot easily be categorized.

Office automation systems such as Microsoft Office and the OpenOffice.org Productivity Suite provide word processing, spreadsheet, and other personal productivity tools, enabling knowledge workers to accomplish their tasks; collaboration systems , such as Microsoft's Exchange/Outlook, Lotus Notes, or Google Apps, provide people with email, automated calendaring, and online, threaded discussions, enabling close collaboration with others, regardless of their location.

Systems for electronic commerce (or e-commerce ), such as corporate websites, are also popular and important. These systems enable (1) consumers to find information about and to purchase goods and services from each other and from business firms and (2) business firms to electronically exchange products, services, and data. In Chapter 4, 'Enabling Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce,' we talk about different forms of electronic commerce involving the end consumer; in Chapter 8, 'Strengthening Business-to-Business Relationships via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management,' we discuss how organizations use the internet to enable or facilitate business-to-business transactions.

While many modern-day information systems span several of these IS categories or integrate different types of systems, it is still useful to understand these categories. Doing so enables you to better understand the myriad approaches, goals, features, and functions of modern information systems.

We have talked about each of the parts of our definition of information systems, and we have talked about different types of information systems. In the next section, we focus on how information systems can be managed within organizations.

ORGANIZING THE IS FUNCTION. Old-school IS personnel believed that they owned and controlled the computing resources, that they knew better than users did, and that they should tell users what they could and could not do with the computing resources; in addition, early IS departments typically had huge project backlogs, and IS personnel would often deliver systems that were over budget, were completed much too late, were difficult to use, and did not always work well. The increasing pervasiveness of technology in businesses and societies has led to a shifting

mindset about information systems within organizations. Increasingly fast-paced competition is forcing businesses to regard IS as an enabler for streamlining business processes, providing better customer service, and better connecting and collaborating with various stakeholders inside and outside the organization. Many organizations, for example, have realized that some of the best ideas for solving business problems come from the employees using the system; as a result, personnel within many IS units have taken on more of a consulting relationship with their users, helping the users solve problems, implement ideas, and be more productive. IS personnel are increasingly reaching out to their internal customers and proactively seek their input and needs rather than waiting for customers to come in with systems complaints. They modify the systems at a moment's notice just to meet customer needs quickly and effectively. They celebrate the customers' new systems ideas rather than putting up roadblocks and giving reasons that the new ideas cannot or will not work. They fundamentally believe that the customers own the technology and the information and that the technology and information are there for the customers, not for the systems personnel. They create help desks, hotlines, information centers, and training centers to support customers. These service-oriented IS units structure the IS function so that it can better serve the customer.

The implications of this new service mentality for the IS function are staggering. It is simply amazing how unproductive a company can be when the IS personnel and other people within the firm are at odds with one another. On the other hand, it is even more amazing how productive and enjoyable work can be when people in the IS function work hand in hand with people throughout the organization. Technology is, potentially, the great lever, but it works best when people work together, not against each other, to use it.

THE SPREAD OF TECHNOLOGY IN ORGANIZATIONS. Another phenomenon that shows how integral and vital information systems and their proper management have become to organizations is the extent to which the technology is firmly integrated and entrenched within the various business units (such as accounting, sales, and marketing).

In many organizations today-especially with increasing use of agile approaches such as 'scrum'-you will find that the builders and managers of a particular information system or subsystem spend most of their time out in the business unit, along with the users of that particular system. Many times, these systems personnel are permanently placed-with an office, desk, phone, and PC-in the business unit along with the users.

In addition, it is not uncommon for systems personnel to have formal education, training, and work experience in information systems as well as in the functional area that the system supports, such as finance. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to separate the technology from the business or the systems staff from the other people in the organization. For this reason, how information systems are managed is important to you, no matter what career option you pursue.

As information systems are used more broadly throughout organizations, IS personnel often have dual-reporting relationships-reporting both to the central IS group and to the business function they serve. Therefore, at least some need for centralized IS planning, deployment, and management continues-particularly with respect to achieving economies of scale in systems acquisition and development and in optimizing systems integration, enterprise networking, and the like. Even in organizations that are decentralizing technology and related decisions, a need to coordinate technology and related decisions across the firm still persists. This coordination is likely to continue to happen through some form of a centralized (or, at least, centrally coordinated) IS staff. Organizations are likely to continue to want to reap the benefits of IS decentralization (flexibility, adaptability, and systems responsiveness), but it is equally likely that they will not want to-and will not be able to-forgo the benefits of IS centralization (coordination, economies of scale, compatibility, and connectivity).

Given the trend toward integrating people from the IS staff into the various business units of the firm and given the need for people within each of the functional areas of the business to have technology skills, there is clearly a need for people who understand both the technology side and the business side of the organization. This is becoming increasingly important due to ever-faster IT cycles: Where traditionally, IS departments thought in time frames of about 5 years, nowadays, new devices (such as new versions of Apple's iPad) come out every 6-18 months, and organizations wanting to harness the opportunities brought about by new devices must adjust to this change in pace.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## Technology Addiction

In 2018, online gaming was designated by health experts as a real, diagnosable addiction. Average adults spent more than 11 hours consuming media each day, 50 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds checked their phone within 5 minutes of waking up, and a third of 25- to 34-year-olds visited social media sites or used mobile apps more than 10 times a day. Between the near-ubiquitous availability of network connectivity and the sheer number of options when it comes to ways to interact online, we are increasingly distracted by information technology, to the point where some doctors argue that we are actually becoming addicted. Dopamine-the brain chemical associated with pleasure-is released when we are stimulated, whether by food, sex, excitement, or interacting online. The hit of dopamine we get when we get a 'like,' update our status, or read the latest tidbit of news or gossip can have the same addicting effect on our bodies as drugs like cocaine or heroin. In addition, being plugged in all the time reduces the brain's ability to let us relax. Hyper-stimulation from having a screen in front of us from when we wake up to when we finally fall asleep causes a type of hyper-arousal-we walk around in a constant state of distraction.

12 seconds at the turn of this century to a mere 8   secondsless than that of a goldfish. Further, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania have shown that social media use decreases our overall health and well-being. However, there may be a bright side. Because the younger generations have been immersed in the technology their entire lives, they may be better able to adjust and adapt-they may develop a better feel for their limits and how to avoid exceeding them.

So what can we do to improve the situation? let's start by turning off the gadgets for a while each day. Improving your overall health helps as well-eat right, stay hydrated, and work out regularly. Finally, get enough sleep and don't fall asleep to Netflix or Facebook.

## The Dual Nature of Information Systems

Given how important and expensive information systems have become, information technology is like a sword-you can use it effectively as a competitive weapon, but, as the old saying goes, those who live by the sword sometimes die by the sword. The two following cases illustrate this dual nature of information systems.

## Case in Point: An Information System Gone Awry: Zoom Outages Disrupt (Almost) Everyone

The COVID-19 pandemic of early 2020 affected people around the globe. Faced with stay-athome orders, travel bans, or other mobility restrictions, people turned to information systems for everything from working from home to conducting the most mundane tasks. Delivery apps saw a surge in popularity, companies scrambled to move documents and workflows to the cloud, and many day-to-day interactions moved online as well. Whereas many companies had long used videoconferencing to replace face-to-face meetings, people suddenly found their entire social livesranging from participating in exercise classes to church service-having moved to Zoom, the popular videoconferencing software (  Figure   1.  14  ). As a result, the company saw a surge in daily meeting participants to over 300 million. Needless to say, such tremendous unforeseen increase in users can quickly cause problems. A notable example happened on May 17, 2020, a Sunday morning (U.S. time), when Zoom users suddenly started experiencing issues accessing the service. While comparatively few businesses and professionals were impacted, the largest impact was for churches, who had moved their services online; with many worshippers being unable to connect, churches across the U.S. were forced to pull the plug and end their Sunday services early. By the

afternoon, Zoom had restored the systems to working order, but this example shows that relying on a single provider can quickly disrupt many activities in unforeseen ways.

## Case in Point: An Information System That Works: FedEx

Just  as  there  are  examples  of  information  systems  gone  wrong,  there  are  many  examples  of information systems gone right. FedEx, a US$69.7 billion family of companies (2019 data), is the world's largest express transportation company, delivering millions of packages and millions of pounds of freight to 220 countries and territories each business day. FedEx uses extensive, interconnected information systems to coordinate more than 490,000 employees, hundreds of aircraft, and more than 180,000 ground vehicles worldwide. To improve its services and sustain a competitive advantage, FedEx continuously updates and fine-tunes its systems. For example, FedEx.com has more than 65 million unique visitors per month and more than 250 million tracking requests per day, and FedEx strives to provide the most accurate tracking information to each visitor. Similarly, in FedEx's ground hubs, automation is another enabler of competitive advantage. En route to its destination, each package typically travels through at least one sorting facility, where it is routed to its intermediate and final destinations (Figure 1.15). Traveling through an extensive network of conveyor belts, each package is scanned multiple times and can be rerouted as needed. Once a package passes an overhead scanner, there is between 1 and 2 seconds of time to divert a package, so decisions must be made in a few hundred milliseconds. On average, FedEx reengineers and improves the performance twice a year and now manages to deliver a quarter of all daily packages handled within 1 business day. These and other information systems have positioned FedEx as the global leader in express transportation.

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## The Social and Environmental Costs of the Newest Gadgets

We all face ethical dilemmas. Such situations, sometimes called  moral  dilemmas, occur when one must choose between two different options, each of which involves breaking a moral imperative. Throughout this book, we will present situations that involve ethical dilemmas for the players involved. For most (if not all) of these situations, there are no definite solutions. In trying to resolve ethical dilemmas, decision makers should take into consideration both the consequences of and the actions involved in each approach: First, consider the consequences of  each potential course of action, in terms of benefits and harms (considering degree and time horizon), to identify the option that maximizes benefits while minimizing harms. The second step is to consider the actions involved (irrespective of the consequences) and to evaluate which actions are least problematic from a moral standpoint (in terms of honesty, fairness, respect, and so on). While you may not arrive at a perfect solution, taking these two factors into account should give you some guidance on how to arrive at a decision.

labor issues, environmental issues have an ethical dimension as well: in search of design aesthetic, Apple famously designs their products as non-repairable. For example, the enormous popularity of Apple's wireless earbuds (AirPods) has been a boon for consumers of the product, but also poses an enormous threat  to  the  environment.  Once  the  batteries degrade-as all lithium-ion batteries do-the spent AirPods are sent to the bin as the batteries cannot be replaced.

There are various ethical dilemmas surrounding the production, use, and disposal of electronic devices, and Apple is no exception. For example, tiny silver letters printed on the back of an iPhone say: 'Designed by Apple in CaliforniaAssembled in China.' globalization has enabled Apple to focus on designing electronics consumers crave while outsourcing the manufacturing of components and assembling of the devices to contract manufacturers on a global scale. However, while Apple keeps tight control over the designs of its devices, it does not always have complete control over how its suppliers build the devices.

As a case in point, Foxconn, one of Apple's primary Chinese assembly partners, was recently scrutinized following a series of complaints of poor working conditions. The pressures of huge production volumes and tight deadlines resulted in pushing workers to their limit, causing twitching hands, uncontrollable mimicking of the motion after work, a rapid burnout rate, the resignation of 50,000 workers each month, and even up to 14 suicides. An independent audit at various factories confirmed that laborers worked excessive overtime and faced health and safety issues. In addition to

Along with the leaders of other technology companies, Apple's CEO Tim Cook faces many dilemmas. For its shareholders, Apple pursues a goal of profit maximization. In pursuing this goal, Apple introduces gadgets consumers crave at an ever-increasing pace, creating a hype around each new device, which, in turn, creates huge demand. There are few suppliers worldwide who can, on relatively short notice, produce the numbers needed to meet the demand for Apple's products, so shifting suppliers is not easy for Apple. At the same time, reducing working hours, raising salaries, or offering other fringe benefits negatively affects Apple's profit margin. Further, for many young Chinese, working at Foxconn for a few months is better than the alternative of tilling the fields of their families' small farming operations or not working at all, as evidenced by the thousands of workers lining up for Foxconn's recruiting sessions every week.

## Questions

1. If you were in Tim Cook's shoes, what would you do?
2. As a consumer, what are your ethical dilemmas associated with the ever-increasing desire for new gadgets?

## Information Systems for Competitive Advantage

The PlayStation Network and FedEx systems are typical of systems that are pervasive in today's life or used in large, complex organizations. These systems are so large in scale and scope that they are difficult to build. It is important to handle the development of such systems the right way the first time around. These examples also show that as we rely more and more on information systems, the capabilities of these systems are paramount to business success.

Not only were these systems large and complicated, but they were-and continue to becritical to the success of the organizations that built them. The choices made in developing the systems at Sony and FedEx were strategic in their intent. Both Sony's PlayStation Network and

FedEx's systems were developed and are continuously updated to help the companies gain or sustain some competitive advantage (Porter, 1985; Porter &amp; Millar, 1985) over their rivals. Let us not let this notion slip by us-while the use of technology can enable efficiency and while information systems must provide a return on investment, technology use can also be strategic and a powerful enabler of competitive advantage.

Although we described the use of information systems at two very large organizations, firms of all types and sizes can use information systems to gain or sustain a competitive advantage over their rivals. Whether it is a small mom-and-pop boutique or a large government agency, every organization can find a way to use information technology to beat its rivals.

At the start of the millennium, as information systems have become standardized and ubiquitous, some have argued that information systems are now more of a commodity that is absolutely necessary for every company, and companies should focus information technology strictly on cost reduction and risk mitigation and that investing in information technology for differentiation or for competitive advantage is futile. Yet, as evidenced by the advances in smartphones, the emergence of social networks, or changes in various creative industries, IT is changing rapidly, and many companies have gained competitive advantage by innovatively using the potential of increasing digital density. Specifically, companies from Amazon to Zappos created competitive advantage by combining certain commoditized technologies with proprietary systems and business processes. Companies with bad business models tend to fail regardless of whether they use information technology, but companies that have good business models and use information technology successfully to carry out those business models tend to be very successful. For companies such as Google or Facebook, data generated by the customers create value, and how data are being gathered, processed, and used can be a source of sustained competitive advantage; other companies, such as Amazon, use their IT expertise to sell cloud computing services to other businesses, directly generating revenue from their IT investments.

In sum, we believe that information systems are a necessary part of doing business and that they can be used to create efficiencies but that they can also be used as an enabler of competitive advantage. Organizations should also note, however, that the competitive advantage from the use of information systems can be fleeting, as competitors can eventually do the same thing.

## IS Ethics

A broad range of ethical issues has emerged through the use and proliferation of computers. Especially with the rise of companies such as Google, which generate tremendous profits by collecting, analyzing, and using their customers' data, and the emergence of social networks such as Facebook, many people fear negative impacts such as social decay, increased consumerism, or loss of privacy. Computer ethics is used to describe moral issues and standards of conduct as they pertain to the use of information systems. In 1986, Richard O. Mason wrote a classic and very insightful article on the issues central to this debate-information privacy, accuracy, property, and accessibility (aka 'PAPA'). These issues focus on what information an individual should have to reveal to others in the workplace or through online transactions, ensuring the authenticity and fidelity of information, who owns information about individuals and how that information can be sold and exchanged, and what information a person or organization has the right to obtain about others and how this information can be accessed and used.

With the societal changes brought about by information systems, the issues surrounding privacy have moved to the forefront of public concern; in addition, the ease of digitally duplicating and sharing information has raised not only privacy concerns but also issues related to intellectual property. Next, we examine these issues.

## Information Privacy

If you use the internet regularly, sending email messages, posting status updates on Facebook, or just visiting websites, you may have felt that your personal privacy is at risk. Several e-commerce websites where you like to shop greet you by name and seem to know which products you are most likely to buy (Figure 1.16); other websites provide you with advertising that appears to be targeted accurately at you. As a result, you may feel as though eyes are on you every time you go online. Information privacy is concerned with what information an individual should have to reveal to others in the workplace or through other transactions, such as online shopping.

Although the Information Age has brought widespread access to information, the downside is that others may now have access to personal information that you would prefer to keep private. Personal information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, medical histories, and even family histories, is now available on the internet. Using search engines, your friends, coworkers, spouse, or even current or future employers can find out almost anything that has been posted by or about you on the internet. For example, it is very easy to locate your personal blog, your most recent party pictures posted on Facebook, or even sensitive questions you asked in a public discussion forum about drug use or mental health. Moreover, many of these pages are stored in the search engines' long-term cache, so they remain accessible for a long time even after they have been taken off the web. Yet some countries are seeking to protect their citizens from this. In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that individuals have the 'right to be forgotten' and that search engines may have to remove links with personal information if the 'information is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive for the purposes of the data processing' (European Commission, n.d.). This ruling, however, creates yet another set of ethical issues, this time centering around censorship of web content. To uphold freedom of expression and freedom of the media, such requests are handled on a case-by-case basis.

INFORMATION PROPERTY ON THE WEB. It happens to all of us. Nearly every day in our physical or virtual mailboxes, we receive unwanted solicitations from credit card companies, department stores, magazines, or charitable organizations. Many of these items are never opened. We ask the same question over and over again: 'How did I get on another mailing list?' Our names, addresses, and other personal data were most likely sold from one company to another for use in mass mailings.

Who owns the computerized data about people-the data that are stored in thousands of databases by retailers, credit card companies, and marketing research companies? The answer is the company that maintains the database of customers or subscribers legally owns the data and is free to sell them. Your name, address, and other data are all legally kept in a company database to be used for the company's future mailings and solicitations, and the company can sell its customer list or parts of it to other companies who want to send similar mailings.

There are limits, however, to what a company can do with such data. For example, if a company stated at one time that its collection of marketing data was to be used strictly internally as a gauge of its own customer base and then sold those data to a second company years later, it would be unethically and illegally breaking its original promise. Companies collect data from credit card purchases (by using a credit card, you indirectly allow this) or from surveys and questionnaires you fill out when applying for a card. They also collect data when you fill in a survey at a bar, restaurant, supermarket, or the mall about the quality of the service or product preferences, or when you provide your email address to access a Wi-Fi network. By providing these data, you implicitly agree that the data can be used as the company wishes (within legal limits, of course).

What is even more problematic is the combination of survey data with transaction data from your credit card purchases. As information systems are becoming more powerful, it becomes easier to collect and analyze various types of data about people. For example, using demographic

data (Who am I, and where do I live?) and psychographic data (What do I like, what are my tastes and preferences?), companies can piece together bits of data about people, creating highly accurate profiles of their customers or users, with each additional bit helping to create a more accurate picture. Such aggregation of data, sometimes referred to as 'the Database of Intentions' (Battelle, 2010), can contain information about what people want, purchase, like, are interested in, or are doing; where they are; who they are; and whom they know (Figure 1.17).

Needless to say, just because people provide data at different points does not mean that they agree for the data to be combined to create a holistic picture. Companies are often walking a fine line, as data about customers are becoming increasingly valuable. Especially in the age of Big Data analytics, there are various concerns, for example, related to discrimination or the selling of personal data but also related to embarrassments resulting from data breaches. Further, advanced analytics of vast amounts of structured and unstructured data about people's behavior enables building predictive models pertaining to people's behavior. Ultimately, this allows manipulating people (e.g., by targeted advertising) and essentially reduces human beings to objects that can be quantified and manipulated and whose value is primarily of commercial nature.

How do you know who is accessing these databases? This is an issue that each company must address at both a strategic/ethical level (Is this something that we should be doing?) and a tactical level (If we do this, what can we do to ensure the security and integrity of the data?). The company needs to ensure proper hiring, training, and supervision of employees who have access to the data and implement the necessary software and hardware security safeguards.

In today's interconnected world, there are even more dangers to information privacy. Although more and more people are concerned about their privacy settings on social networks such as Facebook, there are things that you may not be able to control. For example, if one of your friends (or even a stranger) posts a photo of you on Facebook, it will be there for many others to view, whether you like it or not. By the time you realize it, most of your friends, coworkers, and family members may have already seen it. At other times, you may divulge sensitive data (such as your address or date of birth) when signing up for yet another social network; as newer, more exciting applications come up, you abandon your profile, but your data stay out there. Sometimes, you may forget who is following your activities at the various social networking sites, and you may tell people things you never wanted them to know. As these examples show, there are many more threats to your privacy than you may have thought.

EMAIL PRIVACY. The use of email raises further privacy issues, as nowadays, almost everyone sends and receives electronic mail. Although it is slowly being supplanted by social networking services and messengers such as WhatsApp or Signal, email is still one of the most popular software applications of all time, having contributed greatly to a steady decline of physical mail. However, recent court cases have not supported computer privacy for employee email transmissions and internet usage. For example, most companies provide employees with

access to the internet and email systems, and many periodically monitor the email messages that employees send and receive. Monitoring employee behavior is nothing new, and for many businesses it was a natural extension to monitor employee email messages.

Surprisingly, there is little legal recourse for those who support email privacy. In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), but it offered far stronger support for voice mail than it did for email communications. This act made it much more difficult for anyone (including the government) to eavesdrop on phone conversations. Email privacy is, however, much less protected. In addition, no other laws at the federal or state levels protect email privacy. However, some states, most notably California, have passed laws that define how companies should inform their employees of the monitoring and in which situations monitoring is legal. Even so, this law is more of a guideline for ethical practice than a protection of privacy (Sipior &amp; Ward, 1995).

Fortunately, the ECPA and the court case judgments thus far on email monitoring suggest that companies must be prudent and open about their monitoring of email messages and internet usage. Companies should use good judgment in monitoring email and should make public their policy about email monitoring. One primary reason that employees perceive their email to be private is the fact that they are never told otherwise (Weisband &amp; Reinig, 1995). In addition, employees should use email only as appropriate, based on their company's policy and their own ethical standards. Given recent actions and rulings on the capture and usage of email messages, it appears that online privacy is in jeopardy both in and out of business organizations. As a general rule, we all need to realize that what we type and send via email in and out of the workplace is likely to be read by others for whom the messages were not intended. It is wise to write only those email messages that would not embarrass us if they were made public.

HOW TO MAINTAIN YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE. In general, companies operating in the online world are not required by law to respect your privacy. In other words, a vendor can track what pages you look at, what products you examine in detail, which products you choose to buy, what method of payment you choose to use, and where you have the product delivered. After collecting all those data, unscrupulous vendors can sell them to others, resulting in more directmail advertising, electronic spam in your email inbox, or calls from telemarketers.

When surveyed about concerns related to internet use, most consumers list issues of information privacy as a top concern. As a result, governments have pressured businesses to post their privacy policies on their websites. As outlined in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's 'Fair Information Practice Principles' (Figure 1.18), widely accepted fair information practices include:

- ■ Notice/Awareness. Providing information about what data are gathered, what the data are used for, who will have access to the data, whether provision of the data is required or voluntary, and how confidentiality will be ensured. Such information is typically contained in data privacy statements on a website.

<!-- image -->

## FIGURE 1.18

- ■ Choice/Consent. Providing options about what will be done with the data (e.g., subscription to mailing lists after a purchase). Typically, consumers are given a choice to opt in (i.e., signal agreement to the collection/further use of the data, e.g., by checking a box) or opt out (i.e., signal that data cannot be collected/used in other ways).
- ■ Access/Participation. Providing customers with means to access data collected about them, check for accuracy, and request correction of inaccuracies.
- ■ Integrity/Security. Ensuring integrity of the data (e.g., by using only reputable sources of data) as well as implementing controls against unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction of data (we will discuss these controls in Chapter 10, 'Securing Information Systems').
- ■ Enforcement/Redress. Providing means to enforce these practices, and/or for customers to receive remedies, for example, through self-regulation or appropriate laws and regulations.

Unfortunately, while data privacy statements provide information about, for example, how data will be used, they often do not protect the privacy of consumers. To protect yourself, you should always review the privacy policy of all companies you do business with and refuse to do business with those that do not have a clear policy or do not respect your privacy. To make sure your shopping experience is a good one, you can take a few additional steps to maintain your privacy:

- ■ Choose Websites That Are Monitored by Independent Organizations. Several independent organizations monitor the privacy and business practices of websites (e.g., TRUSTe).
- ■ Avoid Having 'Cookies' Left on Your Machine. Many commercial websites leave cookies on your machine so that the owner of the site can monitor where you go and what you do on the site. To protect your privacy, you should carefully manage your browser's cookie settings or get special 'cookie management' software (see Chapter 10 for more on cookies).
- ■ Visit Sites Anonymously. There are ways to visit websites anonymously. Using private browser windows and search engines such as DuckDuckGo (https:// duckduckgo.com) and turning off features such as ad personalization, you have a high degree of privacy from marketers, identity thieves, or even coworkers when surfing the web.
- ■ Use Caution When Requesting Confirmation E-Mail. When you buy products online, many companies will send you a confirming email message to let you know that the order was received or the item has been shipped. A good strategy is to use a separate email account, such as one that is separate from your work email, when making online purchases.
- ■ Beware What You Post or Say Online. As an old adage goes, 'the internet never forgets'; anything from status updates to Twitter messages to blog posts can be stored forever, and most content remains somewhere on the web, even after the original page has long been taken down. It is safe to say that probably almost everybody engages in some regrettable activities at some point in time. Yet having such activities appear on the web can be devastating for one's career, so use common sense before you post that drunken party pic on Facebook or tweet that you are so bored on your job.

Of course, there are no guarantees that all your online experiences will be problem free, but if you follow the advice provided here, you are much more likely to maintain your privacy.

## Intellectual Property

Another set of ethical issues centers around intellectual property (IP) (i.e., creations of the mind that have commercial value) and the ability to easily download, copy (and potentially modify), and share or distribute digital information. For example, back in the days of analog music, it was all but impossible to create a copy of a song without sacrificing quality. Nowadays, you can almost effortlessly copy your friend's entire digital music library without any quality loss (Figure 1.19); with just a little more effort, you can share it with your friends or even strangers using peer-to-peer networks. Alternatively, you may come across a great photograph or article on the web and share it on Facebook or Instagram without asking for permission from the creator.

<!-- image -->

Similarly, your school may have licensing agreements with certain vendors, allowing you to install and use certain software while you are a student; yet you may forget to uninstall the software after graduating, or you may lend the software to some friend or family member for personal use. In other cases, you may not be able to afford certain programs and download a pirated version from the web.

Just as digital technology enables lossless duplication of files, 3D printing enables creating physical three-dimensional objects from digital models. When building prototypes or manufacturing parts, companies have traditionally used machine tools to drill, cut, or mill the part out of a solid piece of material, leaving up to 90 percent of a slab of material ready to go in the recycling or garbage bin. Instead of removing material, 3D printing successively adds thin layers of material to produce the final object. As 3D printers are becoming better, faster, and more affordable, however, they also open up new avenues for quickly and inexpensively producing counterfeit goods. Obviously, this causes problems for consumers expecting to purchase the original product but also leads to tremendous losses in intellectual property when tools are widely available that enable anyone to manufacture their own copy of a product.

Obviously, there are legal issues associated with each of these scenarios. However, there are also ethical issues associated with such behaviors. You may argue that there was no real loss involved for the creator of the files or software, as otherwise you would have gone for a free alternative or chosen not to purchase the product at all, or you may argue that students do not have the funds to purchase expensive software. These issues become even more complex when viewed from a global perspective. In many non-Western societies, using someone else's work is considered praise for the creator, and it is perfectly alright to use a famous song as background music in a YouTube video or to include another person's writing in one's personal blog (or term paper).

In either case, you are using someone else's intellectual property without permission (and often without attribution) and without compensating the creator.

## The Need for a Code of Ethical Conduct

Not only has the internet age found governments playing catch-up to pass legislation pertaining to computer crime, privacy, and security, but it has also created an ethical conundrum. For instance, the technology exists to rearrange and otherwise change photographs, but is the practice ethical? If you can use a computer at your school or workplace for professional purposes but 'steal' computer time to do personal business, is this ethical? Is it ethical for companies to compile information about your shopping habits, credit history, and other aspects of your life for the purpose of selling such data to others? Should guidelines be in place to dictate how businesses and others use information and computers? If so, what should the guidelines include, and who should write them? Should there be penalties imposed for those who violate established guidelines? If so, who should enforce such penalties?

## FIGURE 1.19

Digital media allows for lossless duplication.

Many businesses have devised guidelines for the ethical use of information technology and computer systems; similarly, most universities and many public school systems have written guidelines for students, faculty, and employees about the ethical use of computers. Most organization and school guidelines encourage all system users to act responsibly, ethically, and legally when using computers and to follow accepted rules of online etiquette as well as federal and state laws.

RESPONSIBLE COMPUTER USE. The Computer Ethics Institute is a research, education, and policy study organization that studies how advances in information technology have affected ethics and corporate and public policy. The institute has issued widely quoted guidelines for the ethical use of computers. The guidelines prohibit the following:

- ■ Using a computer to harm others
- ■ Interfering with other people's computer work
- ■ Snooping in other people's files
- ■ Using a computer to steal
- ■ Using a computer to bear false witness
- ■ Copying or using proprietary software without paying for it
- ■ Using other people's computer resources without authorization or compensation
- ■ Appropriating other people's intellectual output

In addition, the guidelines recommend the following:

- ■ Thinking about social consequences of programs you write and systems you design
- ■ Using a computer in ways that show consideration and respect for others

Responsible computer use includes following the guidelines mentioned here. As a computer user, when in doubt, you should review the ethical guidelines published by your school, place of employment, and/or professional organization. Some users bent on illegal or unethical behavior are attracted by the anonymity they believe the internet affords. But the fact is that we leave electronic tracks as we wander through the web, and many perpetrators have been traced and successfully prosecuted when they thought they had hidden their trails. The fact is, too, that if you post objectionable material on the internet and people complain about it, your internet service provider can ask you to remove the material or remove yourself from the service.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Business Career Outlook

Today, organizations are increasingly moving away from focusing exclusively on local markets. For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers is focusing on forming overseas partnerships to increase its client base and to better serve the regions located away from its U.S. home. This means that not only it is more likely that you will need to travel overseas in your career or even take an overseas assignment, but it is also extremely likely that you will have to work with customers, suppliers, or colleagues from other parts of the world. given this globalization trend, there is a shortage of business professionals with the necessary 'global skills' for operating in the digital world. Three strategies for improving your skills include the following:

1. Gain International Experience. The first strategy is straightforward. Simply put, by gaining international experience, you will more likely possess the necessary cultural sensitivity to empathize with other cultures and, more important, you will be a valuable asset to any global organization.
2. Learn More Than One Language. A second strategy is to learn more than your native language. language problems within global organizations are often hidden beneath the surface. Many people are embarrassed to admit when they don't completely understand a foreign colleague. Unfortunately, the miscommunication of important information can have disastrous effects on the business.
3. Sensitize Yourself to Global Cultural and Political Issues. A third strategy focuses on developing greater sensitivity to the various cultural and political differences within the world. Such sensitivity and awareness can be developed through coursework, seminars, and international travel. Understanding current events and the political climate of international colleagues will enhance communication, cohesiveness, and job performance.

In addition to these strategies, prior to making an international visit or taking an international assignment, there are many things you can do to improve your effectiveness as well as enhance your chances of having fun, and social media play a big role. For example, you can join local groups of expats on Facebook to gather useful information or use online tools such as Babbel or Duolingo to learn a new language or brush up on your language skills. Other suggestions include the following:

1. Read websites, books, newspapers, and magazines about the country.
2. Talk to people who already know the country and its culture.
3. Read travel blogs or view Instagram stories to 'see' the culture through the eyes of a well-versed traveler.
4. Watch locally produced television as well as follow the local news through international news stations and websites.
5. After arriving in the new country, take time to tour local parks, monuments, museums, entertainment locations, and other cultural venues.
6. Share meals and breaks with local workers and discuss more than just work-related issues, such as current local events and issues.

Regardless of what business profession you choose, globalization is a reality within the digital world. In addition to globalization, the proliferation of information systems is having specific ramifications for all careers. For example, managers use enterprise resource planning systems to manage business operations, doctors use healthcare information systems to analyze patient data and diagnose conditions, law enforcement officers use databases to identify gang members by their tattoos, and farmers use geographical information systems to reduce the application of fertilizers and optimize plant yields. In other words, no matter what your career focus is, information systems will be an important part of your job.

## Key Points Review

1. Describe the characteristics of the digital world, contemporary societal issues of the digital world, and how increasing digital density is shaping the digital future. Today, we live in a knowledge society, and information systems have become pervasive throughout our organizational and personal lives. At the same time, we have seen economic, cultural, and technological changes brought about by globalization, and societies face a number of challenges, including demographic changes, rapid urbanization, shifts in global economic power, resource scarcity, and climate change. The possibility to connect physical objects to the digital world has enabled the collection of ever more data; this increasing digital density enables novel interactions and business models, often fueled by the rise of APIs. Being successful in many careers today requires that people be computer literate because the ability to access and effectively operate computing technology is a key part of many careers.
2. Explain what an information system is, contrasting its data, technology, people, and organizational components. An information system is the combination of people and information technology that create, collect, process, store, and distribute useful data. Information technology includes hardware, software, and telecommunications networks. When data are organized in a way that is useful to people, these data are defined as information. The field of information systems is huge, diverse, and growing and encompasses many different people, purposes, systems, and technologies. The people who build, manage, use, and study information systems make up
3. the people component. They include systems analysts, systems programmers, IS professors, and many others. Finally, information systems are used by all organizations, in all industries, so they are said to have an organizational component.
3. Describe the dual nature of information systems in the success and failure of modern organizations. If information systems are conceived, designed, used, and managed effectively and strategically, then together with a sound business model, they can enable organizations to be more effective, to be more productive, to expand their reach, and to gain or sustain competitive advantage over rivals. Modern organizations that embrace and manage information systems effectively and strategically and combine that with sound business models tend to be the organizations that are successful and competitive.
4. Describe how computer ethics affect the use of information systems and discuss the ethical concerns associated with information privacy and intellectual property. Information privacy is concerned with what information an individual should have to reveal to others through the course of employment or through other transactions, such as online shopping. In the Information Age, others may have access to personal information that you would prefer to keep private. This becomes especially problematic as organizations are increasingly able to piece together information about you, forming an ever more complete picture. With the ease of duplicating, manipulating, and sharing digital information, intellectual property becomes an increasingly important issue.

## Database Application: Tracking FrequentFlier Miles at the Campus Travel Agency

- 1-  35. The director of sales and marketing at the travel agency would like to increase the efficiency of handling customers who have frequent-flier accounts. Often, frequent fliers have regular travel routes and a preferred seating area or meal category. In previous years, the data have been manually entered into a three-ring binder. In order to handle the frequent fliers' requests more efficiently, your director has asked you to build an Access database containing the traveler's name (first and last name), address, phone number, frequent-flier number, frequent-flier airline, meal category, and preferred seating area.

To do this, you will need to do the following:

- ■ Create an empty database named 'Frequent Flier.'
- ■ Import the data contained in the file FrequentFliers.txt. Use 'Text File' under 'Import' in the 'External Data' tab. Hint: Use tab delimiters when importing the data; note that the first row contains field names.

After importing the data, create a report displaying the names and addresses of all frequent fliers by doing the following:

- ■ Select 'Report Wizard' under 'Report' in the 'Create' tab.
- ■ Include the fields 'first name,' 'last name,' and 'address' in the report.
- ■ Save the report as 'Frequent Fliers.'

and the United States had the highest internet penetration. However, other countries are catching up. While China had an internet penetration of 52 percent and India had an internet penetration of only 35 percent, they had the largest number of users; further, both countries having much room to grow, both in terms of internet penetration and in terms of numbers (  Table   1.  6  ).

## CASE 1 Apple

Apple is one of the largest, most profitable technology companies in the world. Each year, Apple sells hundreds of millions of its popular iPhones, MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods. Apple's productsand the technology that supports them-have influenced the way people behave and interact. Think how waiting in line at the grocery store or waiting for the next train is more productive, or at least no longer tedious, when you get to check your inbox or watch a video on YouTube. Now remember how insecure you felt the last time you left your smartphone sitting on your living room sofa. Whichever way you look at it, Apple has enjoyed a long streak of successful product launches, with people camping out for days to get their hands on the latest Apple gadgets.

Over the course of its history, Apple had its ups and downs, with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the company's founders, leaving Apple in the 1980s. After Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997, Apple has had an impressive run of successful products, including the iMac, the PowerBook, the iPod, and iTunes. Building on its success with the iPod, Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 and, shortly thereafter, the 'App Store,' revolutionizing the way we purchase and use applications on devices. The era of iPhones continued as successive updates to the iPhone line were introduced year after year, each garnering wider adoption than the last. In 2010, Apple introduced the revolutionary iPad, touted as a 'thirdcategory' device between smartphones and laptop personal computers (PCs). Clearly, innovations fueled by Apple have changed the lives of many people all over the world.

However, Apple has also seen a number of high-profile product failures. From 2016 to 2019, MacBooks suffered from one of the most failure prone keyboard designs caused by their butterfly switch design. Few can forget the famous Unbox Therapy YouTube video illustrating the iPhone 6 Bendgate controversy. Also recall the deceptive practice of slowing iPhone performance without notifying the user. Regulators claimed that significant numbers of customers bought new iPhones because of the slowdown, leading to lawsuits and Apple massively discounting replacement batteries, also known as Batterygate. Besides these recent failures, one of Apple's most visible flops was the Newton, actually the name of a newly conceived operating system that stuck to the product as a whole. The Newton, which Apple promised would 'reinvent personal computing,' fell far short of its hype when it was introduced in 1993 as a not-so-revolutionary personal digital assistant (PDA). Other  notable  Apple  product  failures include: the PowerMac G4 Cube (2000), an 8" × 8" × 8" designer machine that was widely regarded as overpriced; the puck mouse included with the iMac G3 (1998), a too-small, awkward-to-control device that users often mistakenly used upside down; and  the  Lisa  (1983),  whose  whopping US$9,995 price tag (more than US$25,000 in current dollars) made it too expensive for most businesses.

and other devices and accessories. After the death of Steve Jobs in 2011 and the departure of famed designer Jony Ive in 2019, time will tell if Apple's current success streak continues or if, at some point, Apple will yet again introduce a product that is 'too  innovative'  for  their  consumers. Announced in June 2020, the switch from Intel-based technology to proprietary Apple Silicon for computing devices has many Apple fans excited. At the same time, others are questioning the challenging transition from Intel to Apple's mobile-based computing  technology for laptop and desktop computers.

In recent years, Apple has introduced a large variety of new products, all with remarkable success. Innovative products that consumers stand in line to get include the iPhone, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air,

Consider your own adoption of innovative products from Apple (or similar competitors). Apple (and competitors) has become not only a hardware vendor but also a keeper of people's (often private) information and purveyor of that information to app developers and other relevant parties. Although your data is encrypted and in some cases anonymized, personal  information  can  be  used  by Apple or others to predict future behavior and track trends, physical movements, location, music tastes, and more. Connected as we may be to the rest of the world, salient concerns are warranted regarding issues of privacy and information property-that is, who has access to what  and  how  private  information  is being used. Certainly, there are potential risks associated with being an active participant in the digital world, so the next time you purchase an app, think about how much you reveal about yourself with the swipe of your finger.

## CASE 2 Healthcare IS

Healthcare information systems are systems that facilitate the collection and processing of data related to healthcare activities. Historically, such systems were largely focused on the operational needs of healthcare institutions like hospitals and doctor's offices. Mirroring the deployment of information systems in other businesses, systems were developed for accounting, billing, insurance claim processing, human resources, and other business functions. In recent years, however, there has been a push to bring the benefits of information technology to the provision of care itself. Systems are being developed to better generate and track data that are useful to improving health outcomes. A key part of this process is the electronic health record (EHR). An EHR is a comprehensive record that includes your medical and immunization history, laboratory results, and other data such as medical imagery.

When properly maintained and handled, EHRs can have many benefits. Up-todate, complete, and accurate data makes providers more knowledgeable and better able to work with you to make informed decisions about your health. EHRs can enhance patient safety and provide safer care in several ways. EHRs can offer a more complete picture of your health than paper records. Doctors can evaluate your current condition in the proper context of your health history and other treatments you are receiving. EHRs can allow those providing care in an emergency faster access to information they need about your history, allergies, and prescriptions. EHR systems can flag potential conflicts in medication and help pharmacists verify dosages and avoid dispensing the wrong medications. EHRs can also help avoid the need to repeat risky tests and procedures by tracking them better and ensuring the results are available when and where they are needed.

In addition to benefits to individuals, EHRs can lead to better collective health information. Safety hazards, disease outbreaks, high pollution levels, and other risks can be identified more rapidly by analyzing health data in aggregate. Government services and research dollars can be allocated more efficiently focusing on actual community needs. Healthcare processes and procedures can be improved by utilizing modern data analysis techniques on aggregate health data as well. Overall,  there  is  great  potential  to  both improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare delivery costs by utilizing EHR systems.

However, there are also downsides and risks associated with EHR systems. Data privacy and security become even more important when the data in question have to do with such potentially sensitive topics as your health. Records must be properly protected from the same sorts of cyberthreats that other businesses face. Hackers and other malicious actors may seek to steal personal health data to make illicit use of it. In addition, now that they are more readily accessible, there is the concern that health data could be used for improper or undesired purposes. Most people feel that health history should not be used in the making of hiring decisions in general, but there may be acceptable exceptions such as public safety workers or airline pilots. The role of health  history  in  the  availability  and

It has also proven exceptionally difficult to implement EHR systems. Many hospitals and medical facilities rely heavily on paper forms and records. The deployment of EHR systems requires more than simply digitizing the existing forms; in many cases, entire business processes must be redesigned and new information systems developed. There are great opportunities when it comes to healthcare information systems, and there are many great challenges. The benefits for society from improved health and reduced costs must be offset against the potential risks of increasing the amount of our personal and private data available online. The increasing availability of new sources of health data such as activity trackers and other Internet of Things devices will also generate a new set of benefits and risks. Activity trackers can provide data ranging from the number of steps you take each day to vital statistics like heart rate and blood glucose levels. Researchers are even using smartphones to collect data for health studies and clinical trials. Wearables such as the Apple Watch have even saved lives by notifying wearers of potentially dangerous heartbeat rhythms. Such technologies as Apple's Research Kit, Care Kit, and Health Kit allow millions of people to participate in medical research studies quickly and easily. This type of data collection promises to transform large-scale health research. In summary, IS professionals have a great opportunity to assist in the transition to ITbased health systems and in helping to balance the associated risks and rewards.
