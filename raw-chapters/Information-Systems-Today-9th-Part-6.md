## Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence

## Preview

Today,  organizations  operate  in  a  global,  highly  competitive,  and  rapidly  changing  environment.  A  key  to effective management is high-quality and timely information  to  support  decision  making.  Yet,  to  enhance decision making, this high-quality and timely information needs to be extracted from ever-increasing amounts of  structured  and  unstructured  data  gathered  from  a variety  of  sources.  Further,  advances  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  enable  organizations  to  augment  or  even replace human decision making. Here, we first describe the need for enhanced decision making, followed by a description of databases and data warehouses, two fundamental components for gaining business intelligence. Then, we describe the primary IS components utilized by organizations to extract meaningful insights from data. In Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems,' you learned about general types of  information  systems  supporting  organizations'  different  decision-making  levels  and  business  functions that  execute  various  business  processes  to  realize  the strategic goals of the organization. Here, we introduce business intelligence and advanced analytics tools utilized at various decision-making levels  of  modern  organizations.  Finally,  we  discuss  how  knowledge management systems help organizations effectively capture, store, and retrieve organizational knowledge, and how geographic information systems help analyze spatially referenced data to make better business decisions.

## Intelligence Through Drones

O ver the past years, commercially available drones have  made  great  progress;  they  can  recognize obstacles, maintain stable flying positions even under windy conditions, and safely return to their starting position in case of low battery levels. Pennovation Works at the University of Pennsylvania has been a leader in robotics research, including drone technology. These  researchers  created  flying  robots  that  can  sense each other and features of the environment, giving the impression that they have a mind of their own. One business that has emerged from their research is Verge Aero, a company that uses swarm technology to allow thousands of drones to operate in unison and deliver a light show  by  flying  in  a  carefully  orchestrated  formation. What is particularly impressive about the devices is that

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Describe the need for business intelligence, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence and how databases serve as a foundation for making better business decisions.
2.  Explain core concepts of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence.
3.  Describe how organizations can enhance decision making by using knowledge management and geographic information systems.

they are autonomous, meaning that other than receiving instructions about going from point A to point B to create the show, the devices decide where to move and how fast to get there, and are responsible for avoiding collisions. In mid-2020, their drones honored healthcare workers that were fighting COVID-19 by delivering a drone light show as part of the #PhillyShinesBlue campaign.  These  devices  are  only  one  example  of  drone technology  that  could  be  used  in  the  real  world  for other purposes, ranging from package delivery to surveillance to search and rescue operations.

Drone technology for surveillance is a great fit for military  applications  and  provides  real-time  intelligence to troops without putting humans in danger. The U.S. Army has recently deployed tiny helicopter drones that will be able to send both video and thermal images back to the soldiers. DARPA, the U.S. government research agency, has been testing drone swarms that use autonomous artificial intelligence to navigate and map several city blocks and move inside buildings without relying on either GPS for navigation or a remote pilot. These small autonomous drones can fly through open  windows  and  then  navigate  rooms,  stairways, corridors, and other obstacle-filled environments. Such swarm  technology  provides  previously  unattainable intelligence in battle and other high-security situations.

In a more mundane context, Amazon is aggressively working  on  a  drone  delivery  system,  called  Amazon Prime Air, that would allow a package ordered online to  be  delivered  within  30  minutes  by  a  small  flying drone. In Amazon's ideal future, each city would have a  local  warehouse  and  a  small  task  force  of  delivery

drones,  ready  at  a  moment's  notice  to  deliver  thousands of small packages to Amazon's happy customers.

Another implementation of drone technology is in gathering  geographic  data  to  help  farmers  increase efficiencies  and  precision.  Current  drone  technology leverages sensors and artificial intelligence to monitor crops and livestock, deliver fertilizers, and find plots of soil that are most suitable for crop growth (Figure 6.1). Drones are also used to quickly assess the consequences arising from natural disasters, such as flooding, so that farmers may quickly and safely recover from the disaster.  Future  agricultural  drones  will  continue  to  push automation,  especially  when  engaging  in  hazardous surveys  of  extreme  terrain  or  when  extremely  high precision  from  the  advanced  cameras  and  sensors  is required.

The technology described here is still being improved, but things are progressing rapidly. You are likely to have already seen drones at sports events, and drones have made inroads  into  the  hobby  sector,  where  individuals use drones to take travel pictures, hone their flying skills, or spy on their neighbors. With the capabilities of relatively inexpensive drones developing rapidly, varied applications of these technologies can benefit society in a number of different ways.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

1. How can databases support the operation of autonomous and semiautonomous drones?
2. How can the creators of drones use advanced analytics to enable drone technology?
3. How can drones support spatial decision making?

## Enhancing Organizational Decision Making

In Chapter 2, you learned about the importance of strategic planning for gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. To stay ahead of the competition, organizations use information systems to  gather  and  analyze  data  and  information  from  internal  and  external  sources  to  make  better business decisions. To improve organizational performance, business executives are seeking answers to questions such as 'How effective is this year's promotion as compared with last year's?' 'Which customer segments should we focus on?' 'Which customers are most likely to switch to a competitor if we raise prices by X percent?' or, even more important, 'Do we care if those customers switch?' Answers to such questions require analyzing data of past and current transactions to understand what happened. Business intelligence (BI) , referring to tools and techniques for analyzing and visualizing past data, can provide such answers. In contrast, advanced analytics refers to tools and techniques used to understand why something happened, predict future outcomes, or discover hidden patterns in large data sets (sometimes business analytics is used as an umbrella term for these concepts). Today, the need for business intelligence and advanced analytics goes beyond traditional 'businesses'; rather, all types of organizations, ranging from political parties to hospitals, utilize business intelligence and analytics to improve their data-driven decision making (see Table 6.1). In addition, human decision making is increasingly augmented-and sometimes replaced-by machine learning and artificial intelligence (see Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World'), not only in organizational settings, but in various other contexts, ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnoses. Next, we will discuss the need for business intelligence and advanced analytics for making better business decisions.

## Why Organizations Need Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics

Although an organization's overall direction is decided on at the strategic level, business processes span all organizational levels and are highly interconnected. As discussed in Chapter 2, business processes refer to the activities that organizations perform to reach their business goals. Unfortunately, the business processes outlined within strategic plans are often not implemented as envisioned at the managerial and operational levels of the organization because the information needed to effectively monitor and control these processes is simply not available. This 'missing' information, in fact, often exists but resides in disconnected spreadsheets, reports, or databases.

DATA-DRIVEN ORGANIZATIONS. In today's dynamic world, organizations must have up-todate, accurate, and integrated information to monitor and fine-tune a broad range of business processes and to realize the goals of their strategic plans. Consequently, many organizations are trying to create meaningful insights from a variety of data sources to make better business decisions. Organizations that make decisions that can be backed up with verifiable data are referred to as data-driven organizations ; such organizations are measurably more productive and profitable (McAfee &amp; Brynjolfsson, 2012), can better respond to ongoing threats and opportunities, and can better plan for the future. Also, by letting data drive decisions, decision making can be pushed lower into the organization, freeing up senior management time for more important decisions (Redman, 2013). Thus, information systems-such as business intelligence and advanced analytics tools-that enable collecting and analyzing large amounts of data from various sources and delivering needed information to the right decision maker at the right time facilitate the transition to a data-driven organization. As with any technologies, however, having the right tools is not sufficient for business success. In data-driven organizations, familiarity with data analysis and analytics tools is not only the responsibility of data analysts but is a skill required of every business user. In addition, whereas business intelligence and advanced analytics can provide valuable insights, it is human judgment and creativity that are needed to translate these insights into action and make better business decisions.

RESPONDING TO THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES. External factors such as globalization, competitive pressures, consumer demands, societal changes, and governmental regulations can create opportunities as well as threats for modern organizations. For example, globalization provides opportunities to compete in new markets, but also creates the challenge of gathering new types of data to effectively exploit these opportunities. Globalization can also lead to the threat of increased competition from developing countries, forcing organizations to rethink strategies or to further improve business processes. Thus, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, market opportunities will expand, but at the same time, markets will become more competitive, forcing companies to develop new products at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, today's consumers have increasing access to information via social media and mobile devices and can much more easily switch to a competitor's products or services. Further, large corporate and banking failures have brought about more stringent rules and regulations (e.g., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; see Chapter 10, 'Securing Information Systems'), and organizations must comply with ever-increasing government reporting requirements. In sum, today's business environment is characterized by factors such as unstable market conditions, fierce competition, shorter product life cycles, more stringent regulations, and wider choices for customers than ever before. Business intelligence and advanced analytics can help organizations make better decisions in this increasingly complex, fast-changing, and competitive environment by enabling them to collect and analyze both internal and external data more effectively (Figure 6.2).

With increasing pressure to reduce costs, organizations must focus on investing in systems that provide the greatest returns. Business intelligence and advanced analytics solutions can provide quick returns, as they help to quickly react to problems by providing the right information at the right time. Further, these tools help to leverage existing systems (e.g., enterprise-wide information systems; see Chapter 7, 'Enhancing Business Processes Using Enterprise Information Systems') by enabling decision makers to extract and analyze data provided by those systems. Finally, focusing on customer satisfaction can provide quick returns by helping to retain the most profitable customers.

BIG DATA. One significant opportunity for organizations is the abundance of data available for decision making. As highlighted in Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World,' with decreasing costs for capturing and storing data, data are now not only ubiquitous but also cheap. Ever-increasing amounts of data increases the ability to detect meaningful relationships and regularities; thus, insights gained from analyzing Big Data can not only contribute to business success but can also help to address the tremendous challenges society faces. Research has demonstrated a strong link between effective data management and organizational performance, and organizations have long tried to collect, analyze, and use internal and external data to gain and sustain competitive advantage. The increase in digital density has led to a tremendous increase in potentially useful data gathered from mobile devices, social media, automated sensors, and other devices. Big Data is typically characterized as being of high volume, variety , and velocity (see Figure 6.3). One of the biggest opportunities is the sheer volume of data, which, for example, enables organizations to make business decisions based on more factors; yet at the same time, storing, analyzing, and managing increasing amounts of data poses tremendous challenges. The second characteristic is variety. Useful data can come in the form of structured data (such as transaction data), which fit neatly into spreadsheets or databases; semistructured data , such as clickstreams and sensor data; or unstructured data , such as text, audio and video data, comments on social networks, and so on. Semistructured and unstructured data tend to be messy and are often incomplete, and the quality and origins of data such as user-generated content are typically unclear and, at times,

<!-- image -->

questionable; further, analyzing unstructured data tends to be expensive in terms of effort, time, and expertise needed. Finally, Big Data is characterized based on its high velocity. On the one hand, data flow into organizations at increasingly higher rates; on the other hand, datadriven organizations (or systems) must process and use the data ever more quickly, such as when online retailer Amazon is providing recommendations for additional products, or when a self-driving car must decide whether to swerve or brake. Together, Big Data, ranging from geospatial data to customer sentiments, can prove invaluable for formulating and executing an organization's strategy. Data are becoming increasingly abundant, yet many organizations find themselves unable to use these data to make sound business decisions; being able to ask the right questions and successfully utilize Big Data remains elusive for many organizations. Realizing the opportunities and challenges brought about by Big Data and its management, high-level company executives are increasingly focusing on designing an organization-wide data management strategy.

EFFECTIVE PLANNING IS CONTINUOUS. In the past, organizations lacked the necessary data and tools to continuously plan for their future. Typically, organizations would first develop a strategic plan for some planning cycle (say, a year); then, once a strategic plan was agreed on, managers of various business units would prepare budgets for executing their portion of the plan. These budgets were often 'backward looking' because they were typically based on historical data rather than being based on a clear understanding of current conditions and forecasts of future trends. Over time, managers would then execute their portions of the plan. For many organizations, this method of planning and managing was adequate given the relatively slow pace of change.

Today, however, given the need to swiftly respond to a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment, organizations must implement new ways of planning. In fact, successful organizations are utilizing a continuous planning process (Figure 6.4). In a continuous planning process, organizations continuously monitor and analyze data and business processes; the results lead to ongoing adjustments to how the organization is managed, but these results are also reflected in ongoing updates to the organizational plans. It is only through timely and accurate insights gained from analyzing relevant data that continuous planning can be executed.

## GREEN IT

## Sustainability Enabled by Smart Cities

Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and artificial intelligence are transforming countless areas of business and society. Smart cities, in particular, benefit from these technologies as society strives to use our limited resources responsibly. Within a city, there are a variety of infrastructures and systems working together to deliver energy where it is needed, keep traffic flowing smoothly, ensure the safety of citizens, and provide other important services. As our cities continue to grow, the need to increase efficiencies and quality of life for residents is clear and global investment in smart city technology has responded to this need. Investment has already grown to about uS$13 billion per year in 2019 and is expected to increase nearly tenfold to uS$120 billion by 2024.

has implemented sound sensors to monitor and detect gunshots using artificial intelligence, allowing law enforcement to respond more rapidly to violent crime. Another, perhaps unexpected, use of sensors is monitoring garbage containers to ensure that bins are emptied only when needed. Doing so saves energy by eliminating unnecessary trips, as well as improving quality of life and city cleanliness by emptying bins more often, if needed. Relatedly, AI-based object recognition can be used to automatically sort different types of recyclable materials, reducing the potential for incorrectly sorted items.

Within buildings, IoT sensors are especially useful for lighting, heating, or cooling the environment. Sensors gather these data and use artificial intelligence to predict how best to serve residents, while minimizing wasted electricity. Smart grids are also being developed to improve not only how the electricity is used once it reaches a building, but also to predict how to best provision electricity citywide. The European Commission is leading the way for smart grid rollouts and will have installed smart electricity meters on more than 70 percent of homes in the European union by the end of 2020. The data provided by smart grid and smart home sensors fuel many analytical systems for efficient energy use, predicting demand to minimize energy outages, improving responsiveness to energy use anomalies, and providing information that allows residents to make better energy use decisions.

ultimately, Big Data-generated through IoT and other sensors-and expanded use of artificial intelligence hold great promise for identifying cost savings, improving resource efficiencies, and conserving energy as our cities become smarter. Today, we are just beginning to understand how to optimize smart cities using Big Data insights and artificial intelligence. Although it will take time and investment to retrofit older cities and infrastructure with sensors to provide better data, future construction will include a plethora of sensors to deliver on the promise of sustainability in smart cities.

Besides energy, sensors allow cities to accurately monitor and respond to other urban living needs. For example, the Chinese city of Hangzhou implemented artificial intelligence to monitor automobile traffic, resulting in a 15 percent reduction in traffic jams. Cars are not the only source of traffic, as the city of Copenhagen monitors bicycle traffic in real time, improving bike routes for the 40 percent of residents that commute using this type of transportation. new York City

Responding to threats and opportunities and continuous planning are based on analyzing internal data (primarily from the operational level of the organization) as well as external data. In the next section, we describe how databases can be used to provide the necessary inputs to business intelligence and advanced analytics applications.

## Databases: Providing Inputs into Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics

Data and knowledge are probably among the most important assets an organization has, as both are  essential  for  executing  business  processes,  gaining  business  intelligence,  and  performing advanced analytics.  Databases,  which  are  collections  of  related  data  organized  in  a  way  that facilitates data searches, are vital to an organization's success.

For instance, databases are essential for maintaining customer records and supporting business processes such as sales transactions and tracking inventory but are also needed for marketing purposes, such as identifying target customers for personalized marketing communications. Additionally, database technology fuels electronic commerce, from tracking available products for sale to providing customer service. Databases are a foundation of the digital world. Data about all the products that are available for sale at Amazon are stored in databases, and data about all the courses available at your university are stored in a database. In addition to supporting organizational processes, databases are also powering many of the apps you are interacting with daily on your personal devices. For example, data (such as storage location, ratings, or comments) about all of the songs in your iTunes library, together with your playlists, are stored in a database. Databases not only store data about products, courses, songs, and playlists, they also store the interrelationships between various things. For example, Amazon has databases that keep track of its millions of customers and other databases that keep track of the billions of sales transactions linking products to specific customers. Without databases, much of what we take for granted in the digital world would be impossible.

ENABLING INTERACTIVE WEBSITES USING DATABASES. In today's highly dynamic digital world, any organization engaged in e-commerce makes extensive use of databases to provide dynamic and customized content on their web pages. As described in Chapter 3, 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure,' actions such as people using an organization's website to view product catalogs, check inventory, and place orders all ultimately read from and write to the organization's databases. Similarly, data about products (name, description, dimensions, shipping weight, and so on) are stored in databases and dynamically inserted into a web page template, freeing the company from having to develop a separate web page for each individual product. For example, companies such as Amazon need only a few page templates for different product categories. Depending on what the user is looking for, these templates are then populated dynamically with the relevant product data that are pulled from a database; similarly, whenever a registered user places an order, the customer's billing and shipping information is retrieved from a database and displayed to the customer for confirmation.

Some electronic commerce applications can receive and process millions of transactions per day. To ensure adequate system performance for customers, as well as to gain the greatest understanding of customer behavior, organizations must manage online data effectively. For example, Amazon, the world's largest bookstore, is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and its servers log millions of transactions per day, with dozens of database reads and writes for every single transaction. This is but one example that shows that the key to effectively designing an online electronic commerce business is the effective management of online data. Beyond websites and e-commerce, it is important to stress that databases are at the heart of your university's student registration system, the inventory system at the local grocery store, Apple's iTunes store, and virtually anything else you can think of that requires recording and analyzing large amounts of data. Next we examine some basic concepts, advantages of the database approach, and database management.

DATABASES: FOUNDATION CONCEPTS. The database approach dominates nearly all computerbased information systems used today. To understand databases, we must familiarize ourselves with some terminology. In Figure 6.5, we compare database terminology (middle column) with equivalents in a library (left column) and a business office (right column). We use database management systems (DBMSs, such as Microsoft Access, a popular DBMS for personal computers) to interact with the data in databases (see Chapter 3). A DBMS is a software application with which you create, store, organize, and retrieve data from a single database or several databases. In the DBMS, the individual database is a collection of related attributes about entities. An entity is something you collect data about, such as people or classes (Figure 6.6). We often think of entities as tables , where each row is a record and each column is an attribute (also referred to as field). A record is a collection of related attributes about a single instance of an entity. Each record typically consists of many attributes, which are individual pieces of data. For example, a name and a Social Security number are attributes of a particular person.

DATABASES: ADVANTAGES. Before the advent of DBMS, organizations used the file processing approach to store and manipulate data electronically. As data were usually kept in long, sequential computer files that were often stored on tape, data about entities often appeared in several

## FIGURE 6.5

Computers make the process of storing and managing data much easier.

## FIGURE 6.6

different places throughout the information system; further, the data were stored along with and sometimes embedded within the programming code that used the data. People had not yet envisioned the concept of separately storing data about entities in non-redundant databases, so different files frequently contained repetitive data about a customer, a supplier, or another entity. When someone's address changed, it had to be changed in every file where it occurred, a tedious process. Similarly, if programmers changed the code, they had to change the corresponding data along with it. Further, the programmer would have had to know how the data were stored to make any changes. This was often no better than a pen-and-paper approach to storing data.

It is possible for a database to consist of only a single file or table. However, most databases managed under a DBMS consist of multiple tables or entities, often organized in several files. A DBMS can manage hundreds or even thousands of tables simultaneously by linking the tables as part of a single system. The DBMS helps us manage the tremendous volume and complexity of interrelated data so that we can be sure that the right data are accessed, changed, or deleted. For example, if a student or customer address is changed, that change is made through all the parts of the system where that data might occur. Using a database approach prevents unnecessary and problematic redundancies of the data, and the data are kept separate from the applications' programming code. This means that the database does not need to be changed if a change is made to an application. Consequently, there are numerous advantages to using a database approach to managing organizational data; these are summarized in Table 6.2.

TABLE 6.2 Advantages of the Database Approach

| Advantages                                        | Description                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimal data redundancy                           | A single copy of data ensures that storage requirements are minimized.                                                          |
| Improved data consistency                         | Eliminating redundancy greatly reduces the possibilities of inconsistency.                                                      |
| Increased security                                | A centralized system makes it easier to enforce access restrictions.                                                            |
| Improved data quality                             | Centralized control, minimized redundancy, and improved data consistency help to enhance the quality of data.                   |
| Improved data accessibility and sharing           | A centralized system makes it easier to deploy and con- trol access for personnel within or outside organizational boundaries.  |
| Enforcement of standards                          | A centralized system makes it much easier to enforce standards and rules for data creation, modification, naming, and deletion. |
| Program-data independence                         | It is much easier to evolve and alter software to changing business needs when data and programs are independent.               |
| Increased productivity of application development | Data standards make it easier to build and modify applications.                                                                 |
| Reduced program maintenance                       | Data changed in the central database is replicated seam- lessly throughout all applications.                                    |

DATABASES: TYPES. Traditionally, organizations have used relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to support their business processes. An RDBMS attempts to balance efficiency of storage needs, ease of retrieval, and other factors by storing data in tables linked via relationships. However, RDBMSs are not easily scalable in response to peaks in demand, as is often the case in data-intensive applications such as e-commerce and social media, and traditional RDBMSs may simply not be able to handle massive volumes of often-unstructured Big Data. For example, fueled by an increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile, and social connections, various types of data are now generated by countless sensors and millions of users. Further, as RDBMSs tend to be highly complex, any changes need to be carefully planned and managed, potentially reducing the agility of a business. To overcome these limitations, a new breed of database management systems, called NoSQL , is increasingly becoming popular. NoSQL databases such as Amazon's SimpleDB are highly scalable, as they can be distributed across multiple machines, which works especially well in a cloud computing infrastructure. The ability to use not only a single computer but also a distributed computing environment, dividing the processing tasks among hundreds or thousands of machines and using frameworks such as Apache Hadoop (see the Technology Briefing), is key for handling and processing Big Data. Further, NoSQL databases often offer much flexibility in the types of data they can handle (such as comments of various lengths made by Facebook users or audio or video data). However, implementing NoSQL databases comes at a cost, as they are still in their early stages of development; thus, some needed features may be lacking, and it may be difficult to find experienced NoSQL developers.

DATABASES: EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. Now that we have outlined why databases are important to organizations, we can talk about how organizational databases can be managed effectively. The best database in the world is no better than the data it holds. Conversely, all the data in the world will do you no good if they are not organized in a manner in which there are few or no redundancies and in which you can retrieve, analyze, and understand them. The two key elements of an organizational database are the data and the structure of those data. The structure of the data is typically captured in a data model , that is, a map or diagram that represents entities and their relationships. Further, the structure of the data is documented to facilitate management of the database.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## Social Controversy-Think Before You Post

Over the past several years, social media have successfully transformed both the ways of information transmission and the pulse of pop culture. Serving as a source of news for growing numbers of people, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook (and others) also work as a gathering place for expressing compassion, sharing grief, and supporting disaster relief efforts. When the rock star Prince died in 2016, for example, countless collaborators, friends, and well-known fans shared their sadness and memories over the tragic news. For example, actor Will Smith posted, 'I am stunned and heartbroken. I just spoke with him last night. Today, Jada &amp; I mourn with all of you the loss of a beautiful poet, a true inspiration, and one of the most magnificent artists to ever grace this earth.' The speed at which the 'Twitterverse'the  collective  of  members  who  use  the  social  media platform-reacts to important events has transformed how people learn about and react to important events throughout the world.

Indeed, Twitter users' ability to post thoughts in small snippets (called tweets) allows quick and easy dissemination of content to a broad audience. A tweet cannot exceed 280 characters and can thus easily be read out of context; the sheer number of tweets, appearing at a rapid pace and often with little context, can easily result in endless confusion. Thanks to the network effect, Twitter has become capable of gathering momentum so quickly that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between truth and fiction. And, because tweets can be sent so easily, often without a lot of thought by the sender, there are countless examples of so-called 'dumb' tweets that instantly go viral. For example, Chrissy Teigen accidentally leaking her email address, Justin Bieber sharing his phone number, and the everincreasing number of celebrities, public figures, and politicians posting offensive content (many of whom often claim innocence due to being 'hacked'). not only is social and mental harm done to the network of users, once public, their posts are saved forever by those that are quick to take screenshots of social media sites.

In a more serious problem, Twitterbots are causing confusion in the Twitterverse. A Twitterbot is a program used to produce automated posts or to automatically follow Twitter users. Twitterbots come in various forms. For example, many post clickbait, enticing clicks on promotional links. Others post replies or automatically 'retweet' (i.e., forward) messages that include a certain word or phrase. Malicious Twitterbots follow the accounts of famous people who typically have millions of followers. Recently we have observed rampant influence by bots on Twitter, potentially by nations that seek to influence foreign elections. The issue of Twitterbots is so pervasive that researchers at Indiana university have created a software program called Botometer to detect bots, with estimates of up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts being fake. Whether or not these bot accounts actually influence votes is up for debate, but research has shown that many humans cannot recognize bots and interact with them with replies and retweets. While there is no clear answer of how to deal with the Twitterbot issue, it demonstrates some unintended consequences that occur in the digital world. Another glaring issue is the use of algorithms that determine what content will be presented to different users, creating a filter bubble for individual users   (see Case 1 in   Chapter   5  , 'Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration using Social Media')  . For companies seeking exposure to their posts, this means that they will either have to promote their posts (and pay for it), or continually chase ever-changing algorithms; recently, lush Cosmetics, which had heavily used social media to engage with its customers, decided to close its Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram channels, taking a stance against the rule of the algorithms.

When properly used for good, social media are undoubtedly a meaningful platform for reaching out to people. Sometimes, however, people seem to retweet first and ask questions later; it may be better to do 'due diligence' and try to Google a topic first to ensure that it, indeed, is true before retweeting. Further, as shown by lush Cosmetics, engaging with customers on social media can be challenging. Just remember, if you follow famous people on social media and you get a crazy message from them, it may be from a bot.

Each attribute in the database needs to be of a certain type. For example, an attribute may contain text, numbers, or dates. This data type helps the DBMS organize and sort the data, complete calculations, and allocate storage space. If tables are designed correctly, they will be easier to update, and it will be faster to extract vital information to improve an organization's business intelligence capabilities.

Once the data model is created, the format of the data is documented in a data dictionary . The data dictionary (or metadata repository) is a document explaining several pieces of metadata for each attribute, such as its name, the type of data expected (dates, alphanumeric, numbers, and so on), and valid values. Data dictionaries can include information such as why the data item is needed, how often it should be updated, on which forms and reports the data appear, or how it is used in organizational processes.

Data dictionaries often include business rules -that is, the policies by which a business runs-which help to prevent illegal or illogical entries from entering the database. For example, designers of a warehouse inventory database could capture a rule in the data dictionary to prevent an invalid ship date for a future order from being entered into the database. Although NoSQL databases may not be as rigid as RDMBSs or may not enforce business rules at all (leaving the enforcing to applications), it is wise to create data models and to consider what data will be captured, how the data will be related, and what rules should be enforced.

Master Data Management To make sound operational, tactical, and strategic business decisions, it is imperative that decisions made in different departments are based on the same underlying data, definitions, and assumptions-that is, there is a 'single version of the truth.' For example, do the marketing and accounting departments have the same definitions of a customer or a sale? Does a 'customer' entail anyone who may be interested in the company's product or service (marketing view) or only those who actually made a purchase (accounting view)? Part of creating a single version of the truth is master data management . Master data are the data deemed most important in the operation of a business. Typically shared among multiple organizational units, master data include data about customers, suppliers, inventory, employees, and the like. You can think of master data as the 'actors' in an organization's transactions; for example, a customer purchases something, an employee is paid, and so on. Given the importance of an organization's master data, master data management is a management- rather than a technology-focused issue, as different business units and different corporate levels must come to consensus on the meaning of master data items or on how to deal with duplicates. Especially for large organizations, arriving at a single version of the truth can be a challenge, as master data often must be integrated from multiple systems. Likewise, after mergers or acquisitions, organizations must consolidate the master data from two or more companies. Once the meaning and format of the master data have been agreed on, business intelligence applications can base their analyses on the single version of the truth.

ENTERING AND QUERYING DATA. At some point, data must be entered into the database. Traditionally, a clerk or other data entry professional would create records in the database by entering data. These data may come from telephone conversations, preprinted forms that must be filled out, historical records, or electronic files. Today, much organizational data are captured electronically, as is the case with a user's input in a web form; whenever you place an order on the web, sign up for a newsletter, or respond to an online survey, your input is directly stored in a database. A form (Figure 6.7) typically has blanks where the user can enter data or make choices, each of which represents an attribute within a database record (such as the user's first name, last name, gender, and so on). A form should be organized in an intuitive way so that the user can easily see the required items and enter the data. Forms are often used to capture data to be added, modified, or deleted from the database (e.g., for modifying your password or removing your old shipping address on Amazon). Further, in today's dynamic environment, data are increasingly generated and captured automatically. For example, capturing transactional data from a point-of-sale terminal or entering sensor data from smartphones or IoT devices requires no human intervention; likewise, autonomous agents (discussed later) can collect various data that are published on the web or posted in social media.

## FIGURE 6.8

This sample SQL statement would be used to retrieve the information needed to populate a summary web page containing all books written by the first author of this textbook, sorted by publication date.

<!-- image -->

To retrieve data from a database, we use a query . In fact, whenever a web page is dynamically populated with content, a query is executed to retrieve the data from a database. The most common language used to interface with RDBMSs is Structured Query Language (SQL) . Figure 6.8 is an example of an SQL statement that an online bookstore would use to retrieve the information needed to populate a summary page containing all books written by the first author of this textbook, sorted by publication date. Writing SQL statements can be difficult, especially when you are dealing with complex databases with many entities or when you are writing complex queries with multiple integrated criteria-such as adding numbers while sorting on two different attributes. Many desktop DBMS packages provide graphical user interfaces, where the user can pick the desired data from the database to create queries quickly and easily (Figure 6.9).

AD HOC QUERIES AND REPORTS. Business users across an organization need the right information at the right time; thus, to support decision making, the results of queries are typically presented in the form of reports. A report is a compilation of data from the database that is organized and displayed to the user (either on screen or on paper). Sophisticated report generators and analysis tools such as Crystal Reports or Tableau can help users to quickly build interactive reports and visualizations to present data in a useful format and help business users make sense of large amounts of data that are typically stored in organizational databases. Reports can take the form of scheduled reports , drill-down reports , exception reports , and key-indicator reports (Table 6.3) (as discussed in Chapter 2, key performance indicators are the metrics deemed most critical to assessing progress toward a certain goal). These reports are either produced at prespecified intervals or created whenever a prespecified event happens; often, this is combined with automated alerts if certain thresholds are reached. However, decision makers frequently have information needs that are unforeseen and may never arise again. In such instances, the users need to run ad hoc queries (i.e., queries created because of unplanned information needs that are typically not saved for later use). Ad hoc query tools provide an easy-to-use interface, allowing managers to run queries and reports themselves without having to know query languages or the structure of the underlying data. Installed on a

ORDER BY PUBLICATION\_DATE;

person's desktop, notebook computer, or mobile device, these tools can be used to run queries and reports whenever an unplanned information need arises without having to resort to calling the IS department for help in creating a complex query or a special report.

ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING. The systems that are used to interact with customers and run a business in real time are called operational systems . Examples of operational systems are sales order processing and reservation systems. As fast customer response is fundamental to having a successful internet-based business, immediate automated responses to the requests of users are required. Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems provide this and are designed to handle multiple concurrent transactions from customers. Typically, these transactions have a fixed number of inputs, such as order items, payment data, and customer name and address, and specified outputs, such as total order price or order tracking number. Common transactions include updating customer data, processing orders, and generating sales receipts. Consequently, OLTP is a big part of interactive electronic commerce applications. Because customers can be located virtually anywhere in the world, it is critical that transactions be processed efficiently. The speed with which OLTP systems can process transactions is, therefore, an important design decision. In addition to which technology is chosen to process the transactions, how the data are organized in the database is also a major factor in determining system performance.

Although the database operations behind most transactions are relatively simple, designers often spend considerable time making adjustments to the database design to 'tune' processing for optimal system performance. Once an organization has all these data, it must design ways to gain the greatest value from its collection; each individual OLTP system could be queried individually, but the real power for an organization comes from analyzing the aggregation of data from different systems using methods such as online analytical processing (discussed later).

OPERATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL SYSTEMS. Operational systems can generate a wealth of data that can serve as useful inputs into business intelligence and advanced analytics applications. For example, a grocery checkout system processes a specific transaction (the purchase) that can be linked to an inventory system (for reordering purposes), but it can also capture valuable data such as time of the purchase, items purchased together, form of payment, or loyalty program details. Coupled with external data (such as store location, weather data, or competitor information), these data can be analyzed for spending patterns, effectiveness of sales promotions, or customer profiling.

Systems designed to support decision making based on stable point-in-time or historical data are called informational systems . The requirements for designing and supporting operational and informational systems are quite different (Table 6.4). In a distributed online environment, performing real-time analytical processing diminishes the performance of transaction processing. For example, complex analytical queries require the locking of data resources for extended periods of execution time, whereas transactional events-data insertions and simple queries from customers-are fast and can often occur simultaneously; further, the operational databases typically only contain current data. Thus, a well-tuned and responsive transaction processing system may have uneven performance for customers while analytical processing occurs. As a result, many organizations replicate all transactions on a second database server so that analytical processing does not affect transaction processing performance. This replication typically occurs in batches during off-peak hours, when site traffic volumes are at a minimum. However, especially for situations where real-time analytics is needed (such as fraud detection), even a few hours' delay is unacceptable. Therefore, modern database management systems provide real-time operational analytics-allowing OLTP and analytics to be performed simultaneously-for the analysis of data coming from a single data source (such as an organization's ERP system).

DATA WAREHOUSES AND DATA LAKES. For many complex analyses, however, data from various sources are needed. Therefore, large organizations, such as Walmart, UPS, and Alaska Airlines, have built data warehouses that integrate multiple large databases and other data sources into a single repository. Such a repository, containing both historic and (almost) current data for analysis and reporting, is suitable for direct querying, analysis, or processing. Much like a physical warehouse for products and components, a data warehouse stores and distributes data on computer-based information systems. A data warehouse is a company's virtual storehouse of valuable data from the organization's disparate information systems and external sources. It supports the analysis of sales, inventory, and other vital business data that have been culled from operational systems. The purpose of a data warehouse is to put key business information into the hands of more decision makers, and an organization that successfully deploys a data warehouse has committed to pulling together, integrating, and sharing critical corporate data throughout the firm. Table 6.5 lists sample industry uses of data warehouses. Data warehouses can take up hundreds of gigabytes (even terabytes) of data. They typically run on powerful mainframe computers or a cluster of smaller computers, often costing millions of dollars.

## TABLE 6.5 Sample Industry Uses of Data Warehousing

| Customer profiling                                             | Morgan Stanley             |

While no changes to the existing, historical data contained in the data warehouse are made, the data in a data warehouse are periodically appended with 'new' data from operational systems. Consequently, a crucial process for consolidating data from operational systems with other organizational data (to facilitate the use of data mining techniques to gain the greatest and broadest understanding from the data) is extraction, transformation, and loading . First, the data need to be extracted from various different source systems. In the transformation stage, data are being cleansed and manipulated to fit the needs of the analysis (such as by creating new calculated fields or summary values). Data cleansing refers to the process of detecting, correcting (e.g., standardizing the format), or removing corrupt or inaccurate data retrieved from different source systems (such as differences in the way dates or ZIP codes are stored). Finally, the transformed data are loaded into the data warehouse and are ready for being used for complex analyses (Figure 6.10).

With the increase of unstructured data, traditional data warehouses impose limitations, in that they typically only accommodate structured data and focus on data quality. To allow for advanced analytics of (often unstructured) raw data, organizations implement so-called data lakes , which are central repositories allowing for storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in a raw format.

DATA MARTS. Rather than storing all enterprise data in one data warehouse, many organizations have created multiple data marts, each containing a subset of the data for a single aspect of a company's business, such as finance, inventory, or personnel. A data mart is a data warehouse that is limited in scope. It contains selected data from the data warehouse such that each separate data mart is customized for the decision support needs of a particular end-user group. As a data mart only contains the data needed by a limited segment of users (as opposed to a companywide data warehouse), it is typically easier to query and reduces the time needed to perform analytical queries. Data marts have been popular among small and medium-sized businesses and among departments within larger organizations, all of which were previously prohibited from developing their own data warehouses because of the high costs involved.

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Emotion Aware Technology

Imagine playing a video game that seems to be able to read your mind or at least know when you are confident or when you are scared. And, depending upon how you are feeling, it would adapt to either make things easier or tougher on you. Or imagine driving your car while drowsy, angry, or distracted, and having your car respond to your needs by adjusting the climate controls or giving you a gentle nudge. According to Rana el Kaliouby of Affectiva, a Boston area tech company, 'technology has a lot of cognitive intelligence, or IQ, but no emotional intelligence, EQ.' Affectiva uses sensors such as microphones and cameras, written sentiments, and other inputs to classify and respond to human emotions using artificial intelligence. With this information and ability to respond to our human emotional needs, human computer interactions can be improved by building trust between human and machine.

the upsides of the technology are extremely promising, we can't forget the possible downsides. First, interpretations of emotions are not always consistent between cultures, so extensive testing would have to be conducted to ensure reliability worldwide. Additionally, what are the ethical consequences of a marketer knowing a consumer's emotional state? We also know that artificial intelligence can suffer from algorithmic discrimination, such as incorrectly identifying suspects of crimes using facial recognition or providing biased hiring recommendations, and making decisions based on a user's emotions likewise is unlikely to be free from biases and negative consequences.

## Based on:

Besides automotive and gaming applications, emotional intelligence could provide other benefits to society. For example, the technology could be used to interpret an autistic child's emotional state, improving the quality of life for the child and the caregiver. The technology could also be used to enhance interactions between consumers and marketers, by providing media analytics to test and report on our reactions to videos, movies, political candidates, and advertising.

Data marts typically contain tens of gigabytes of data as opposed to the hundreds of gigabytes in data warehouses. Therefore, data marts can be deployed on less powerful hardware. The difference in costs between different types of data marts and data warehouses can be significant. The cost to develop a data mart is typically less than US$1 million, while the cost for a data warehouse can exceed US$10 million. However, with the advent of cloud computing, several vendors are offering data warehousing as a service, which can help to significantly lower the company's initial investment   (see   Chapter   3  )  ; similarly, companies such as SAP are offering on-demand business intelligence as a service.

## Business Intelligence, Advanced Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence

Various different vendors offer a wide variety of tools for decision support; such tools are often classified as business intelligence and advanced analytics applications. Typically, business intelligence tools provide decision support by enabling business users to perform analyses to obtain an understanding of what has happened. Advanced analytics tools, in contrast, provide decision support by enabling business users as well as business analysts and data scientist to gain a deeper understanding of why things happened and to build predictive models. Although each type of application by itself can be valuable to an organization, it is their convergence that enables organizations to gain and sustain competitive advantage through enhanced decision making. In the following sections, we discuss these categories as well as the various systems and technologies that each encompasses.

## Business Intelligence

Business intelligence tools are used by business users to analyze both structured and unstructured data to obtain an understanding of current and past performance, helping to guide planning

processes. Given vast amounts of data, business intelligence tools help users perform analyses and interpret data. In the following sections, we describe some of these applications.

DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. Traditionally, organizations used decision support systems (DSSs) to analyze structured data and support their decision making. DSSs are often used by managerial-level employees to help them solve problems such as sales forecasting or resource optimization, yet DSSs can be used to support decisions at virtually all levels of the organization. A DSS is designed to be an 'interactive' decision aid that uses models to manipulate data. For example, if you have some historic sales data, you can use many different types of models to create a forecast of future sales. One technique is to take an average of past sales and adjust it for seasonal changes. The formula you would use to calculate and adjust the average is the model. A more complicated forecasting model might use time-series analysis or linear regression.

Using such models, DSSs can augment human decision-making performance and problem solving by enabling managers to perform 'what-if' analyses to examine alternative solutions to a problem. A what-if analysis allows users to make hypothetical changes to the data associated with a problem (e.g., loan duration or interest rate) and observe how these changes influence the results. For example, a cash manager for a bank could examine what-if scenarios modelling the effects of various interest rates on cash availability. Some types of problems utilize a variety of input variables that each may have a different likelihood of occurring (e.g., there is a 25 percent likelihood that inflation will stay the same and a 75 percent likelihood that inflation will increase). Sensitivity analysis allows a user to understand how different input values and their probability of occurring (e.g., rate of inflation and its probability of occurring) will affect the results of a model. Similarly, goal-seeking analyses help in determining how input parameters need to be changed to achieve a desired end state. Finally, optimization models allow finding the best balance between certain parameters within given constraints. Together, DSSs provide managers with various decision analysis tools to either analyze data or create meaningful information to support the decision making related to a variety of organizational problems. See Table 6.6 for a summary of the ways organizations can use DSS to support decision making in organizations. While DSSs are useful for supporting a variety of managerial decisions, they are typically limited to relatively simple analyses of structured data, typically from transaction processing systems.

ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING. Online analytical processing (OLAP) refers to the process of quickly conducting complex, multidimensional analyses of data stored in a database that is optimized for retrieval, typically using graphical software tools. OLAP tools enable users to perform ad hoc analyses of different dimensions of data beyond simple data summaries and data aggregations of normal database queries. A typical question asked would be 'What were the profits for each week in 2020 by sales region and customer type?'

a deeper understanding of the underlying data. Given the high volume of transactions within internet-based systems and the potential business value in the data, business intelligence tools must provide extensive OLAP capabilities to business users. The chief component of an OLAP system is the OLAP server , which understands how data are organized in the database and has special functions for analyzing the data. The use of dedicated databases allows for tremendous increases in retrieval speed. In the past, multidimensional queries against large transactional databases could take hours to run; in contrast, OLAP systems pre-aggregate data so that only the subset of the data necessary for the queries is extracted, greatly improving performance. Given the decrease in cost of random access memory (RAM, see the Technology Briefing), a recent trend is in-memory computing , where the data are stored in a computer's main memory rather than on a comparatively slow hard drive, removing the bottlenecks associated with reading and writing data. Further, using in-memory computing for both transaction and analytical processing can help provide answers to questions as they arise and enable making business decisions based on real-time data.

Measures and Dimensions Whenever a business transaction occurs, associated data can be stored and then analyzed from a variety of perspectives. To facilitate efficient processing of transactions, databases supporting online transaction processing systems treat all data in similar ways. In contrast, OLAP systems are designed for efficient retrieval of data and categorize data as measures and dimensions. Measures (or sometimes called facts ) are the values or numbers the user wants to analyze, such as sales revenues or the number of orders placed. Dimensions provide a way to summarize the data, such as region, time, or product line. Thus, sales revenue (a measure) could be analyzed by product, time (year, quarter, or week), geographical region, or distributor (the dimensions). To enable the analysis of data at more or less detailed levels, the dimensions are organized as hierarchies (such as in year, quarter, month, or day). For example, when analyzing sales by geographical regions, a user can drill down from state, to county, to city, or to the individual store location or roll up from state to sales region (northwest, south, southeast, and so on), to country, or to continent.

Cubes, Slicing, and Dicing To enable such multidimensional analyses, OLAP arranges the data in so-called cubes. An OLAP cube is a data structure allowing for multiple dimensions to be added to a traditional two-dimensional table (Figure 6.11). Although the figure only shows three dimensions, data can be analyzed in more than three dimensions. Analyzing the data on subsets of the dimensions is referred to as slicing and dicing . For example, a slice may show sales by product type and region only for the second quarter of 2020. Another slice may only show sales for desktops in the western region (Figure 6.12).

INFORMATION VISUALIZATION. In addition to allowing business users to perform various queries and analyses, an important aspect of business intelligence applications is information visualization. Visualization refers to the display of complex data relationships using a variety of graphical methods, enabling managers to quickly grasp the results of the analyses. A popular trend in visualizing data and relationships that you will have encountered is infographics, which use a combination of colors, sizes, and shapes to visualize data.

Digital Dashboards Digital dashboards are commonly used to visually present key performance indicators and other summary information used by managers and executives to make decisions. To provide the greatest benefits for decision makers, digital dashboards typically support three usage models: push reporting, exception reporting and alerts, and pull reporting. Often created with software such as Tableau, digital dashboards not only provide the decision makers with a quick, visual overview of key performance indicators and other key operational statistics and trends (i.e., push reporting) but also alert the user of any items that require immediate attention (i.e., exception reporting and alerts); if the user wants to analyze the root causes of an exception or perform other analyses, he or she can drill down or perform selfservice ad hoc queries (i.e., pull reporting).

Digital dashboards (sometimes called executive dashboards) provide top-level managers with the needed information to support business processes, such as cash and investment management, resource allocation, and contract negotiation. Typically, executives require information presented in a highly aggregated form so that they can scan information quickly for trends and anomalies (Figure 6.13).

Although data are typically provided in a highly aggregated form, the dashboard also provides the capability to drill down and examine the details, if necessary. For example, suppose a digital dashboard summarizes profits by states. If the executive wants to get a deeper understanding about a particular state, a selection on the screen can provide the details behind the aggregate. By drilling down into the data, the executive can see that the majority of the profits were made in a particular region or city or even store. Also, the information provided can be easily shared throughout the organization so that the executive can quickly send a message to the appropriate managers to discuss solutions to the problem discovered in the drill-down.

Dashboards make use of a variety of design elements to present the data in the most userfriendly way. To highlight deviations that need to be addressed or to symbolize changes over time, dashboards use maps, charts, spark lines, graphics symbolizing traffic lights, thermometers, or speedometers (Figure 6.14); conditional formatting is often used to highlight exceptions and draw the user's attention to deviations from the normal course of business.

One recent trend influencing the design of dashboards is mobile business intelligence. With the advances in mobile communication technology, today's executives want to be in touch with their organizational performance anytime, anywhere. Further, most of today's knowledge workers are increasingly mobile in terms of the device they're using-during a workday, one may use a desktop computer, a laptop, a smartphone, or an iPad. Hence, dashboard vendors are offering solutions for multiple devices and screen sizes so that each user can get the most current information regardless of location and device used, facilitating business decisions based on real-time data (Figure 6.15).

One of the growing trends of mobile business intelligence (BI) is the use of location data that can easily be gained from GPS or Wi-Fi networks. This capability can be an important part of an innovative BI solution because location-relevant information can be delivered to the device based on its location. For example, details about particular people, such as customers, colleagues, and staff, within a particular vicinity can be sent to the device in addition to locationspecific reports. With such capabilities, the mobile device uses its data generation capabilities to enhance the intelligence of the user.

Visual Analytics As discussed in previous sections, business intelligence systems can provide business decision makers with a wide variety of analyses to support decision making. However, in the end, it is still the humans who must interpret the output from these systems. With the growing complexity of the underlying data (such as multiple dimensions, including spatial dimensions), interpreting the outputs becomes extremely challenging. Visual analytics (sometimes called visual data discovery ) is the combination of various analysis techniques and interactive visualizations to solve complex problems. By combining human intelligence

<!-- image -->

and reasoning capabilities with technology's retrieval and analysis capabilities, visual analytics can help in decision making, as the strengths of both the human and the machine are merged. With the humans' ability to make sense of 'noisy' data, unexpected patterns or relationships in the data can be discovered, and results of complex queries can be quickly interpreted. Visual analytics is used in a variety of settings, ranging from homeland security to disaster relief. For example, making sense of tabular data about the strength of a hurricane (including information about location of clouds, etc.) is nearly impossible. Figure 6.16 shows the visualization of a hurricane as it is gaining strength. The image shows towering thunderclouds (in red), called hot towers, that were spotted just before the hurricane intensified to a Category 5 hurricane. Once the hurricane is represented visually, analysts can view changes over time to better understand its behavior. In similar ways, organizations around the world are utilizing visualization technologies to enhance business intelligence.

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Smarter than the Superbugs

Drug-resistant bacterial infections-known as superbugslead to about 35,000 deaths each year in the united States alone. unfortunately, superbugs cannot be easily treated with a simple antibiotic in the same way you were treated the last time you had strep throat or a sinus infection. The latter, more common, bacterial infections can be eliminated with a several days' course of antibiotics that your medical provider or pharmacy can prescribe. Superbugs, however, often require infected patients to be admitted to intensive care units in the hospital, and often lead to death of the patient. So, then, what do superbugs have to do with technology and digital density? Researchers from MIT and Harvard have recently used deep learning to discover a novel use for an existing liver disease treatment by repurposing it as an antibiotic that destroys a deadly superbug found on the World Health Organization's 'highest priority pathogens' list.

results of their research produced a small number of candidates for physical testing, and one proved effective at killing two deadly bacteria that are totally resistant to existing antibiotic treatments. In other words, vast amounts of existing data are being used in conjunction with newly developed deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques to save lives.

## Advanced Analytics and Artificial Intelligence

In contrast to business intelligence tools, which primarily focus on analyzing structured or semistructured  data  to  examine  past  and  current  performance,  advanced  analytics  are  designed  to help users gain a deeper understanding of why things happened and build predictive models to support human and automated decision making (the term data science is used to describe the advanced analytics field of study and practice). As such, advanced analytics uses both structured and unstructured data to automatically gain meaningful insights by discovering patterns, trends, and  relationships.  Whereas  business  intelligence  tools  are  primarily  used  by  business  users, advanced analytics are often used by business analysts or data scientists due to the complexity of the models and the underlying data. Enabled by advanced analytics are intelligent systems, which are designed to take some of these decisions out of the hands of the human decision makers, thus freeing up valuable resources.

DATA MINING. Data mining complements OLAP in that it provides capabilities for discovering 'hidden' predictive relationships in the data. Using complicated algorithms on powerful multiprocessor computers or cloud computing architectures, data mining applications can analyze massive amounts of data to identify characteristics of profitable customers, purchasing patterns, or even fraudulent credit card transactions. An algorithm refers to the step-by-step procedures used to make a calculation or perform some type of computer-based process. Typically, data mining algorithms search for patterns, trends, or rules that are hidden in the data so as to develop predictive models. Results from a data mining exercise (such as the characteristics of customers most likely to respond to a marketing campaign for a specific new product) can then be used in an ad hoc query (e.g., to identify customers sharing those characteristics so as to target them in the next campaign). It is important to note that any interesting predictive model derived from data mining should be tested against 'fresh' data to determine if the model actually holds what it promises.

Sometimes, data mining is completely atheoretical, and companies search for hidden relationships between data, akin to panning for gold. In other cases, business users formulate hypotheses (such as 'customers with a household income of US$150,000 are twice as likely to respond to our marketing campaigns as customers with an income of US$60,000 or less'), and these hypotheses are tested against existing data. However, as with other business intelligence tools, being able to ask the right questions is the most crucial skill and should come before jumping into conclusions about the outcomes.

To increase predictive power, data mining algorithms are run against large data sets. Depending on the size of the data set (large data sets can contain many terabytes of data), data mining algorithms can take a long time to run; thus, an important preparatory step to running data mining algorithms is data reduction , which reduces the complexity of the data to be analyzed. This can be achieved by rolling up a data cube to the smallest level of aggregation needed, reducing the dimensionality, or dividing continuous measures into discrete intervals.

Association Discovery One frequently used application of data mining is association discovery. Association discovery is a technique used to find associations or correlations among sets of items. For example, a supermarket chain wants to find out which items are typically purchased together to redesign the store's layout and optimize the customers' 'navigational path' through the store or to launch a new promotion. Mining sales transactions over the past 5 years may reveal that 80 percent of the time, people who purchase coffee also purchase sugar (Figure 6.17). Association rules typically contain two numbers: a percentage indicating support (e.g., the combination of coffee and sugar occurs in 20 percent of all transactions analyzed) and a confidence level indicating the reliability (e.g., 80 percent of all transactions that contain coffee also contain sugar). These numbers help managers decide if the association rule is meaningful and if any changes (e.g., to store layout or pricing) based on the findings are worthwhile. Similar to association discovery, sequence discovery is used to discover associations over time. For example, it may be discovered that 55 percent of all customers who purchase a new highdefinition TV set also purchase a Blu-ray disc player within the next 2 months.

Clustering and Classification Another useful application of data mining is clustering and classification. Clustering is the process of grouping related records together based on having similar values for attributes, thus finding structure in the data (clustering is an example of unsupervised learning , i.e., inferring hidden patterns in unlabeled data). For example, a manufacturer of consumer electronics may find clusters around model preferences, age groups, and income levels. These results can then be used for targeting certain groups of customers in marketing campaigns. In contrast, classification is used when the groups ('classes') are known beforehand, and records are segmented into these classes (an example of supervised learning , i.e., training an algorithm using known training data). For example, a bank may have found that there are different classes of customers who differ in their likelihood of defaulting on a loan. As such, all customers can be classified into different (known) risk categories to ensure that the bank does not exceed a desired level of risk within its loan portfolio. Typically, classification would use a decision tree to classify the records.

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## Orwellian Internet of Things

In 1949, English author George Orwell wrote the novel 1984, which described a futuristic tyrannical society with omnipresent government surveillance by an entity known as 'Big Brother.' Big Brother was not a helpful and nurturing sibling but an entity that seeks power for its own sake and not for the good of others. Since his writing, Orwellian is an adjective reflecting actions that could be destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. Privacy advocates are concerned that many types of gadgets and home automation and other IoT devices, when paired with advanced analytics capabilities, have the potential to have Orwellian impacts on society.

There are a wide range of IoT devices that are designed to scoop up massive amounts of data to aid humans and other systems in our modern society. But as more and more data are collected and analyzed, many privacy advocates fear we are losing more and more of our anonymity and individual freedom. For example, when considering IoT devices, privacy advocates are concerned with a variety of questions. What data are IoT devices collecting? Who has access to these data? How can these data be used? And, as news reports demonstrate, IoT data can be used in unexpected, interesting, and legally significant ways.

Imagine all of the things that could be equipped with a sensor and have data collected about their use. For example, things like your toaster, refrigerator, thermostat, lighting, and even the front door lock on your apartment. All of those seem kind of cool, right? What about your toilet? That doesn't sound too cool. If you have any concerns about the government reading your email, how would you feel about a database collecting information on every time your toilet flushes? Imagine what a medical research group could do with such data. In sum, the data collected for every thing could end up in the hands of law enforcement, the government, marketing companies, and even malicious hackers. And this is not science fiction.

enforcement for use in helping to secure convictions and aid in surveillance. The threat is not just from your own government, as IoT devices allow entry points for hackers and foreign nations into your home. In fact, the u.S. FBI recommends placing your IoT devices on separate networks in your house (i.e., one Wi-Fi network for IoT devices, a separate Wi-Fi network for computers) to make it more difficult for hacked IoT devices to gain access to your personal computers.

In combination with advanced analytics, IoT technologies will allow companies to provide unprecedented services to customers. Reminders, automatic ordering, activity tracking, and a plethora of other conveniences are becoming a normal part of our lives. However, while receiving all of these conveniences, we are also providing an abundance of data about our daily lives that can, at a minimum, be a privacy invasion or be misused by malicious crackers or even our own government. While such Orwellian concerns were not possible in 1984, in today's digital world, Big Brother has arrived.

## Questions

1. If you use a fitness tracker or some other IoT device, should the company be able to sell your data? Would it be acceptable to share the data with some but not others? Explain.
2. Typically, the company providing an IoT device owns its customers' data. What laws or rules are needed to balance the needs of the company and the privacy of customers?

In 2016, the u.S. director of national intelligence, James Clapper, made it clear that IoT sensors and devices are providing ample opportunities for intelligence agencies to spy on targets. In fact, IoT device manufacturers have turned over data  from  their  devices  hundreds  of  times  to  law

UNSTRUCTURED DATA ANALYSIS. Although the methods just described can help decision makers get a better view of their organization's performance or their customers' behavior, they only provide a partial picture. By focusing purely on structured data (such as transactions, credit lines, and so on), a wealth of unstructured data (such as customer sentiments voiced in online forums, letters, or service-related call center records) is left untapped; in fact, researchers estimate that 80 to 90 percent of all data generated consist of unstructured or semistructured data (Marr, 2019). Therefore, making important business decisions purely based on structured data can be dangerous, as the massive amounts of unstructured data could either strengthen

or contradict findings derived from analyzing only structured data. Hence, organizations are trying not only to reach a single version of the truth but also to get the whole truth by analyzing unstructured data using text mining, web content mining, or web usage mining .

Text Mining and Web Content Mining Text mining refers to the use of analytical techniques for extracting information from textual documents. For organizations, the analysis of textual documents can provide extremely valuable insights into business performance, competitors' activities, or regulatory compliance. Such textual documents can include internal data such as letters or emails from customers, customer calls, internal communications, or external data such as blog posts, wikis, Twitter messages, and Facebook posts as well as competitor's web pages, marketing materials, patent filings, and so on. Further, increasingly sophisticated speech recognition algorithms enable the analysis of not only written, but also spoken text. Text mining systems use natural language processing, statistical analyses, machine learning, and other techniques to analyze a document's linguistic structures to extract data such as places, companies, concepts, or dates. Most systems can easily extract a wide range of content and can be customized to meet an organization's needs by adding specific key words related to competitors, product names, persons of interest, and the like. Obviously, when analyzing and using user-generated content, companies must be aware of issues related to ethics and privacy but also security.

Web content mining refers to extracting textual information from web documents. To extract information from the overall internet (or from some subset of websites), a document collection spider, or web crawler (discussed later), would gather web pages and documents that match some prespecified criteria and place their content in a massive document warehouse. Once collected, the text mining system would apply a variety of analytical techniques to produce reports that can be used to gain additional insights beyond what is typically gained when only mining structured data (Figure 6.18). The next challenge for organizations will be extracting useful information from audio or video streams on the web (so-called multimedia mining).

## FIGURE   6.  19

Business intelligence can be delivered to users in a variety of ways.

Analyzing textual documents can help organizations in various ways:

- ■ The marketing department can use sentiment analysis to learn about customers' thoughts, feelings, and emotions by analyzing not only customer emails or letters but also blogs, wikis, or discussion forums.
- ■ The operations department can learn about product performance by analyzing service records, customer calls, or online product reviews and improve the product's features or performance based on insights gained.
- ■ Strategic decision makers can gather competitive intelligence by analyzing press releases, news articles, or customer-generated web content about competitors' products.
- ■ The sales department can learn about major accounts by analyzing news coverage.
- ■ The human resources department can monitor employee satisfaction or compliance with company policies by analyzing internal communications (this is especially important when complying with regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  ; see   Chapter   10  ).
- ■ News reporters or intelligence agencies can find out what topics are trending when trying to understand public sentiments in unstable countries.
- ■ Investigators can identify possible instances of noncompliance and fraud by analyzing email communication within a company in a regulated industry.

Many major companies, including Capital One, Marriott International, United Airlines, and Walmart, use text mining solutions to assess customer sentiments and increase customer satisfaction.   We will further discuss social media monitoring and sentiment analysis and their role in customer relationship management in   Chapter   8  , 'Strengthening Business-to-Business Relationships via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management.'

Web Usage Mining Web usage mining -also referred to as web analytics-is used by organizations such as Amazon to determine patterns in customers' usage data, such as how users navigate through the site or how much time they spend on different pages. By analyzing users' clickstream data (i.e., a recording of a user's path through a website), a business such as Amazon can assess its pages' stickiness (i.e., the ability to attract and keep visitors) and how customers navigate through different item categories, ultimately helping Amazon to optimize the structure of its website. In addition, organizations can monitor users' mouse cursor movements to infer which areas of a web page get most attention by the visitors.

As with other business analytics systems, results from these analyses can be provided on digital dashboards, paper reports, web portals, email alerts (using monitoring or data mining agents), and mobile devices as well as used by a variety of other information systems (  Figure   6.  19  ).

MACHINE LEARNING. Whereas 'conventional' computers are very adept at processing large amounts of data by rapidly executing a program's instructions, they cannot easily adapt to different circumstances or deal with noisy data. If a conventional computer is presented with a novel problem that it is not programmed to solve, it cannot deal with this situation. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn by identifying meaningful patterns when processing massive amounts of structured or unstructured data. Machine learning has enabled great advances in various fields; intelligent systems (discussed below) such as autonomous vehicles but also speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, web searching, image recognition, or predictive typing (e.g., using smartphone keyboards such as SwiftKey or Swype) are based on advances in machine learning algorithms. Recently, Netflix started applying machine learning algorithms to improve movie recommendations. One frequently used approach to machine learning is the use of artificial neural networks; neural networks , composed of a network of processing elements (i.e., artificial 'neurons') that work in parallel to complete a task, attempt to approximate the functioning of the human brain and can learn by example. Typically, a neural network is trained by having it categorize a large database of past information (e.g., a database of handwritten digits) for common patterns so as to infer rules (e.g., what features differentiate the digit 1 from a 7). These rules can then be applied to new data and conclusions drawn. For example, many financial institutions use neural network systems to analyze loan applications. These systems compare a person's loan application data with the neural network containing the intelligence of the success and failure of countless prior loans, ultimately recommending loan acceptance (or rejection) (Figure 6.20). Newer neural-network based approaches-called deep learning , using multiple layers of neurons to extract features from input data-are getting ever closer to mimicking the human brain and enable great advances in areas such as voice or speech recognition; in 2016, banks started using voice recognition to identify online banking customers. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have made great progress, especially in applications where inputs and tasks are imprecise, such as classifying images. In particular, using Bayesian statistics or fuzzy logic allows using approximations or subjective values to handle situations where information about a problem is incomplete or imprecise. For example, a loan officer, when assessing a customer's loan application, may generally categorize some of the customer's financial information, such as income and debt level, as high, moderate, or low rather than using precise amounts. In addition to numerous business applications, fuzzy logic is used to better control antilock braking systems and household appliances as well as when making medical diagnoses or filtering offensive language in chat rooms.

PREDICTIVE MODELING. Traditional business intelligence applications are designed to focus on past and current performance, thus helping decision makers to get a detailed picture about the current state of a business. Advanced analytics augments business intelligence by using combinations of statistical analysis, data mining, and machine learning for predictive modeling to build explanatory models that help understand data, identify trends, or predict business outcomes; whereas business intelligence is good for knowing what is , advanced analytics helps in understanding why something is a certain way and foreseeing what will be . As such, predictive modeling tools extend traditional DSS and other BI tools by supporting forecasting, simulation, and optimization based on large volumes of structured, semistructured, and sometimes unstructured data. For example, predictive modeling can help in developing predictive patterns based on not only historical purchase data (structured data) but also customer sentiments voiced in social media or call center records (unstructured data). Likewise, Uber is attempting to improve its pricing mechanism using predictive modeling. Under Uber's current 'surge pricing' mechanism, fares increase if there is increased demand (such as after concerts or during bad weather), which, in theory, should bring more drivers into an area where this increase in demand takes place. However, customers are often frustrated by being charged higher prices. Thus, Uber tries to build predictive models that are better able to forecast increased demand in certain areas at certain times, decreasing the effect of surges. However, predictive modeling is heavily dependent on statistical models and their underlying assumptions; likewise, as with all advanced analytics, analyzing unstructured data still remains relatively costly.

INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science of enabling information technologies-software, hardware, networks, and so on-to simulate human intelligence, such as reasoning and learning, as well as gaining sensing capabilities, such as seeing, hearing, or

feeling. AI has had a strong connection to science fiction writers, who have written stories about AI-enabled technologies aiding humans (e.g., Mr. Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation ), attempting world domination (e.g., The Matrix ), or ruling over an alien race (e.g., the Supreme Intelligence in Captain Marvel ). Whereas these visions have yet to be realized, AI has become pervasive, and you are probably interacting with more AI-based tools than you might realize.

Based on complex machine learning algorithms, intelligent systems -composed of sensors, software, and computers embedded in machines and devices-emulate and enhance human capabilities. Intelligent systems are having a tremendous impact in a variety of areas, including banking and financial management, medicine, engineering, and the military. Big Data has been both a challenge and an opportunity for artificial intelligence. On the one hand, vast amounts of different forms of data make machine learning algorithms increasingly complex; on the other hand, Big Data provides a treasure trove of potential insights and applications of intelligent systems. For many applications, intelligent systems assist in or perform real-time decision making, often using vast amounts of data. For example, many see vast promises in the use of AI for trading, removing the influence of traders' emotions, which often lead to suboptimal trading decisions. Likewise, advanced driver assistance systems (such as adaptive cruise control or lane-keeping systems offered in various new car models) or autonomous cars rely on intelligent systems to make real-time decisions based on up to 1GB of data per second, coming from various sensors, cameras, or radar. Over the past few years, the cost of sensors has been in free fall;

for example, accelerometer sensors (built into many smartphones to measure motion) now cost only around US$0.50. The combination of machine learning and decreasing prices of sensors is fueling the development of sensor-driven computing. Sensors providing data about everything from motion to voltage to pressure or even chemistry can provide a tremendous amount of useful data, which can then be used to improve performance, a device's life span, and so on. Artificial intelligence also fuels the rapid advances in drone technology and robotics that we see today, such as drones that can monitor product placement and stock levels in Walmart's warehouses or robots built to replace human pickers in Amazon's warehouses. Further, the combination of AI and sensors has enabled the creation of collaborative robots, which can work alongside human workers (and react if there is possible danger) instead of having to be placed in segregated areas. The advances in artificial intelligence are likely to progress even further with the development of microchips developed specifically for AI applications, as well as further use of cloud computing infrastructures.

However, advances in artificial intelligence have fueled many ethical debates, such as how to ensure that AI (and robots) only learns in the way humans intend. For example, using unsupervised learning, a robot (or other intelligent system) can improve its own learning by making changes to learning rules and monitoring the results; as a consequence, such intelligent systems must be programmed to stop the system without the system learning how to circumvent this. Likewise, many ethical issues surround facial recognition technologies, such as Facebook's Deepface program (which recognizes users in pictures), Apple's FaceUnlock, or the use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies. All such systems offer great potential for abuse if the technologies or data fall into the wrong hands. Another big area of concern is algorithmic discrimination, which refers to bias in algorithms; for example, algorithms trained on unbalanced datasets are likely to perpetuate discrimination, do not recognize people of color, and so on.

Intelligent Agent Systems An intelligent agent , or simply an agent (also called a bot -short for 'software robot'), is a program that works in the background to provide some service when a specific event occurs. There are several types of agents for use in a broad range of contexts, including the following:

- ■ User Agents . Agents that automatically perform a task for a user, such as automatically sending a report at the first of the month, assembling customized news, or filling out a web form with routine information.
- ■ Buyer Agents (Shopping Bots) . Agents that search to find the best price for a particular product you wish to purchase.
- ■ Monitoring and Sensing Agents . Agents that keep track of key data, such as data provided by various sensors, meters, cameras, and the like, notifying the user when conditions change.
- ■ Data Mining Agents . Agents that continuously analyze large data warehouses to detect changes deemed important by a user, sending a notification when such changes occur.
- ■ Web Crawlers . Agents that continuously browse the web for specific information (e.g., used by search engines)-also known as web spiders .
- ■ Chatbots . Agents that simulate human conversations, such as in online help systems. In the past few years, chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated, replacing many customer service interactions.
- ■ Destructive Agents . Malicious agents designed by spammers and other internet attackers to farm email addresses off websites or deposit spyware on machines.

One example of an intelligent agent is Apple's Siri personal assistant, built into its iPhones. Similarly, Cortana is a personal assistant built into various Microsoft platforms, and Amazon's Alexa is built into different devices, such as smart speakers. Over time, Cortana learns about a user's habits and performs certain actions based on certain triggers such as time of the day, location, incoming or outgoing phone calls, searches, and so on. For example, in the morning, the user automatically receives an alert about the weather in his or her current location; when passing by a subway station, public transport information is presented; when on a trip, the time to travel back home is automatically calculated (taking into consideration factors such as traffic situation); and so on (Figure 6.21).

## SECURITY MATTERS

## You Can't Handle the Deepfakes

Can you believe that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted on video that he was in total control of our stolen data? Did you see that video where President Obama called President Trump an expletive? You know, the ending of Game of Thrones could have been better. At least Jon Snow apologized for it, didn't he? All of these videos looked real but were completely fabricated, faked, and counterfeit. Deepfakes ('deep learning' plus 'fake') take advantage of new developments in artificial intelligence to manipulate original digital content into something else entirely. up until now, most deepfakes were just advanced implementations of socalled Photoshopped digital content, often manipulated for the purpose of deception, malicious intent, or sometimes just having fun.

Deepfake software utilizes artificial intelligence encoders to map and learn facial features. The process allows the algorithm to find feature similarities between multiple faces, and in the case of video, swap faces and audio to modify the real video for another purpose. For example, the faked video of President Obama mapped his face and that of comedian Jordan Peele, resulting in a composite video that showed President Obama's face, but with facial expressions and mouth anchored to Jordan Peele's recorded audio. Voices can also be cloned and synthesized into saying whatever the faker would like the audio to say. Faked audio has already been manipulated to clone the voice of a CEO in the uK, and the attackers successfully used a wire transfer scam to extort uS$220,000 from the company.

which tries to determine if the image or video was generated or not. If the discriminator determines that the image was generated, the generator corrects the image, until the discriminator is unable to distinguish it from a 'real' image.

unfortunately, deepfakes pose a severe threat to society, as the technology can be used for extremist causes, to misinform recipients, conduct political attacks, or even to tarnish someone's reputation. until deepfake detection technology is mainstream and can protect us from these attacks, the best thing we can do is to question what we see or hear and conduct additional research before taking action or blindly believing any message that we find plausible. Photoshopped is so last year-deepfakes are here, and we should be afraid.

Early deepfakes were easy to spot because of the digital artifacts and glitches that were present in the videos. However, the technology has progressed rapidly, and in less than a year, deepfakes have become quite believable. One feature that makes deepfakes so difficult to detect is the way they are generated. Modern approaches to generating deepfakes employ generative adversarial networks , which consist of a generator that creates the deepfake and a discriminator ,

Another emergent use of intelligent agents is robotic process automation, which is a technique used to automate repetitive organizational tasks. Robotic process automation (RPA) monitors the way users perform specific tasks and uses artificial intelligence to analyze these tasks to be able to automate their execution in the future. This allows organizations to save time and resources for preforming tasks ranging from copying and pasting data to extracting content from documents or web pages.

In sum, there are ongoing developments to make information systems smarter so that organizational decision makers gain business intelligence. Although intelligent systems have yet to realize the imagination of science fiction writers, they have taken great strides in helping organizations enhance decision making and have added convenience to various aspects of our everyday lives.

## Knowledge Management and Geographic Information Systems

As you have seen, there are various tools organizations can use to enhance their decision making. In addition to analyses and predictions using various types of structured and unstructured data, organizations draw on other sources of data and knowledge. In particular, organizations use knowledge management systems to manage organizational knowledge assets and use geographic information systems to manage and analyze spatially referenced data to provide spatial decision support. These are discussed next.

## Knowledge Management Systems

There is no universal agreement on what exactly is meant by the term knowledge management . In general, however, knowledge management refers to the processes an organization uses to gain the greatest value from its knowledge assets. In Chapter 1, we contrasted data, information, and knowledge. Recall that data are raw, unformatted symbols such as characters or numbers. Information is data that have been formatted, organized, or processed in some way so that the result is useful to people. We need knowledge to understand relationships between different pieces of information. Consequently, what constitutes knowledge assets are all the underlying skills, routines, practices, principles, formulas, methods, heuristics, and intuitions. All databases, manuals, reference works, textbooks, diagrams, displays, computer files, proposals, plans, and any other artifacts in which both facts and procedures are recorded and stored are considered knowledge assets. From an organizational point of view, properly used knowledge assets enable an organization to improve its efficiency, effectiveness, and, of course, profitability. Additionally, as many companies are beginning to lose a large number of baby boomers to retirement, companies are using knowledge management systems to capture these crucial knowledge assets. Clearly, effectively managing knowledge assets will enhance business intelligence.

Knowledge assets can be categorized as being either explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge assets reflect knowledge that can be documented, archived, and codified, often with the help of information systems. Explicit knowledge assets reflect much of what is typically stored in a

Explicit knowledge assets can easily be documented, archived, and codified, whereas tacit knowledge assets are located in a person's mind.

DBMS. In contrast, tacit knowledge assets reflect the processes and procedures that are located in a person's mind on how to effectively perform a particular task (Figure 6.22). Identifying key tacit knowledge assets and managing these assets so that they are accurate and available to people throughout the organization remains a significant challenge.

Tacit knowledge assets often reflect an organization's best practices -procedures and processes that are widely accepted as being among the most effective and/or efficient. Identifying how to recognize, generate, store, share, and manage this tacit knowledge is the primary objective for deploying a knowledge management system. Consequently, a knowledge management system is typically not a single technology but rather a collection of technology-based tools that include communication technologies-such as email, collaboration software, instant messaging, and the like-as well as information storage and retrieval systems, such as wikis or DBMSs, to enable the generation, storage, sharing, and management of tacit and explicit knowledge assets (Malhotra, 2005).

Benefits and Challenges of Knowledge Management Systems Organizations can derive many potential benefits from effectively capturing and utilizing their tacit knowledge assets (Levinson, 2010) (Table 6.7). Although there are many potential benefits for organizations that effectively deploy knowledge management systems, to do so requires that several substantial challenges be overcome.

First, effective deployment requires employees to agree to share their personal tacit knowledge assets and to take extra steps to utilize the system for identifying best practices. Therefore, organizations must create a culture that values and rewards widespread participation.

Second, experience has shown that a successful deployment must first identify what knowledge is needed, why it is needed, and who is likely to have this knowledge. Once an organization understands 'why, what, and who,' identifying the best technologies for facilitating knowledge exchange is a much easier task.

TABLE 6.7 Benefits and Challenges of Knowledge Management Systems

| Benefits                                                                                                                                                                              | Challenges                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced innovation and creativity Improved customer service, shorter product development, and streamlined operations Enhanced employee retention Improved organizational performance | Getting employee buy-in Focusing too much on technology Forgetting the goal Dealing with knowledge overload and obsolescence |

Third, the successful deployment of a knowledge management system must be linked to a specific business objective (e.g., increase innovativeness); and fourth, the knowledge management system must be easy to use, not only for entering but also for retrieving knowledge. Similarly, the system cannot overload users with too much information or with information that is obsolete. Just as physical assets can erode over time, knowledge can also become stale and irrelevant. Therefore, an ongoing process of updating, amending, and removing obsolete or irrelevant knowledge must occur, or the system will fall into disarray and will not be used.

How Organizations Utilize Knowledge Management Systems The people using a knowledge management system will be working in different departments within the organization, performing different functions, and will likely be located in different locations around the building, the city, or even the world. Each person-or group of people-can be thought of as a separate island that is set apart from others by geography, job focus, expertise, age, and gender. Often, a person on one island is trying to solve a problem that has already been solved by another person located on some other island. Finding this 'other' person is often a significant challenge. The goal of a successful knowledge management system is to facilitate the exchange of needed knowledge between these separate islands. To find and connect such separate islands, organizations use social network analysis , a technique that maps people's contacts to discover connections or missing links (sometimes called structural holes) within the organization (Figure 6.23); thus, social network analysis can be used to attempt to find groups of people who work together, to find people who don't collaborate but should, or to find experts in particular subject areas. In addition to social network analysis, organizations use social bookmarking and social cataloging to capture and structure employees' knowledge and harness their collective intelligence (see Chapter 5, 'Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media').

Once organizations have collected their knowledge into a repository, they must find an easy way to share it with employees (often using an intranet), customers, suppliers (often using an extranet), or the general public (often using the internet). These knowledge portals can be customized to meet the unique needs of their intended users. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses a web-based knowledge portal for keeping the public (e.g., citizens, researchers, and industry) informed on the most up-to-date information related to food (e.g., information on mad cow disease or product recalls) and drugs (e.g., the status of a drug trial) (Figure 6.24).

In addition to the FDA, countless other organizations, such as Ford Motor Company, Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Dell Computers, are also using knowledge management systems. We are learning from these deployments that all organizations, whether for-profit or nonprofit, struggle to get the right information to the right person at the right time. Through the use of a comprehensive strategy for managing knowledge assets, organizations are much more likely to gain a competitive advantage and a positive return on their IS investments.

## Geographic Information Systems

One  type  of  information  system  used  to  enhance  decision  making  is  called  a geographic information system (GIS) . A GIS is a system for creating, storing, analyzing, and managing geographically referenced data. In other words, GISs augment and extend other business analytics tools by adding a spatial dimension to data; a GIS captures various characteristics about geographic locations,  allowing  these  characteristics  to  be  coupled  with  other  data  to  support querying, analysis, and decision making (sometimes referred to as location analytics or location intelligence). For example, a GIS could link the square footage of commercial real estate to its exact location in terms of latitude and longitude. These data could be paired with population density, average incomes of people living within an area, travel accessibility (e.g., interstate highways and major thoroughfares), proximity to services (e.g., fire, police, restaurants, public transportation stops), or virtually any other characteristic. A business such as a restaurant chain could use this information to identify optimal locations for the placement of new outlets. On a personal level, you probably frequently interact with GISs. For example, when you're accessing Google Maps to search for a restaurant in your town, you can view geographic data (such as the map or the satellite image) as well as attribute data about restaurants, including name, address, opening hours, and customer reviews. With the increase in mobile devices, geospatial data is increasingly becoming part of many applications and often serves as the foundation for many business models. For example, companies such as the car-hailing app Uber could not provide services without being able to match the locations of riders and drivers.

Businesses typically face many decisions with a spatial dimension: Where are my customers located? Where is the best location to open a new store? Which areas should be included in the next mailing? How far are my customers willing to drive? One application of GISs is their use as spatial decision support system, helping to create models used to answer questions such as where a company such as Levi Strauss should add authorized resellers or how, where, and what kinds of fertilizers farmers should apply, enabling precision farming (see Table 6.8 for various industry uses of GISs). Depending on the problem to be solved, spatial decision support systems can use factors such as climate, water, transportation, resource management, agriculture, and so on, to build models that help forecast potential outcomes of land use decisions.

In organizational settings, analysts can use GISs to combine geographic, demographic, and other data for locating target customers, finding optimal site locations, or determining the right product mix at different locations; additionally, GISs can be used to perform a variety of analyses, such as market share analysis and competitor analysis. Cities, counties, and states also use GISs for aiding in infrastructure design and zoning issues (e.g., where should the new elementary school be located?). For the various geospatial aspects you can map with GISs, refer to Table 6.9.

How does a GIS help in visually analyzing geospatial and related data? Typically, a GIS provides a user with a blank map of an area. The user can then add data stored in different layers ,

each resembling a transparency containing different information about the area; for example, one layer may contain all roads, another layer may contain ZIP code boundaries, and yet other layers may contain floodplains, average household sizes, locations of coffee shops, or other information of interest (e.g., in Google Earth, you can view various layers, such as roads, traffic patterns, weather, earthquakes, golf courses, and so on; see Figure 6.25). Adding or removing those layers helps to view the relevant information needed to answer questions that have a spatial dimension.

One question that organizations often face is where the customers come from. To answer this question, organizations typically use data from survey respondents (or the cashier asks for customers' ZIP codes); these data are then geocoded (i.e., transformed into coordinates) to create a layer containing customer data that can then be added to a map. Comparing customers' locations with the location of one's business can help in deciding whether the store has the optimal location or whether opening a new store would be warranted. Relatedly, trade area analysis helps to assess where customers are coming from by combining location information with, for example, drive time information to determine if certain areas are underserved or if two stores' trade areas overlap. Another way to visualize geospatial data is by using thematic maps. Thematic maps colorcode data that are aggregated for specific geographic regions. For example, a thematic map could display the median household income in different blocks, or it could display average household sizes, helping a business to identify areas with the most promising target population; similarly, an insurance company could use GISs to determine where certain crimes (such as car theft) most frequently occur. Another use of GIS is analyzing paths shoppers take in a retail store, allowing retailers to assess whether the placement of products or promotional displays is effective.

GIS benefit greatly from advances in machine learning, especially for recognizing and classifying geographical features, such as land or soil. In particularly, many situations (e.g., agriculture, resource extraction, or nature conservation) require the analysis of aerial imagery (acquired using satellites or drones). Typically, such classification tasks are inherently imprecise and do not lend themselves easily to binary classifications. Machine learning algorithms, however, enable such analyses, offering much potential for applications ranging from agriculture to disaster recovery.

Further, the Internet of Things and mobile technologies have enabled far more meaningful analyses than ever. For example, Google Maps performs real-time analyses of location data from literally hundreds of millions of mobile phone users (such as Android users who have location services enabled or iPhone users running Google Maps) to estimate the number of cars and traffic conditions on any given road; such analyses enable Google to provide information about traffic conditions and suggest alternative routes in case there are traffic jams on a given route. In addition, Google has used these data to build a tremendous repository of historical traffic

data, allowing Google to predict how traffic conditions are likely to be once a user reaches a certain area. Likewise, the data collected by countless IoT devices can be augmented with geospatial data, allowing users to harness the benefits of IoT technologies in mobile settings, where precise information about a sensor's location is needed.

In addition to helping in analysis, GISs are also increasingly used by governments and organizations to effectively communicate with stakeholders. For example, many retail chains such as Best Buy and Walmart incorporate map-based store locators into their websites. When users search for a store by city, state, or ZIP code, the website returns a map showing the store's location (geographic data) along with attribute data such as distance, street address, phone number, and opening hours. Similarly, organizations use output from GISs to communicate to their stockholders about expansion plans, retail store density, and the like.

Clearly, GISs, like all the systems described here, are providing organizations with business intelligence to better compete in the digital world.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Healthcare

Do you remember the times when your doctor wrote a prescription and the handwriting was worse than your professor's, making you wonder how the pharmacist could ever decipher it and dispense the correct drugs? If you recently went to a doctor, you may have noticed that information systems have had a huge impact on the healthcare field; indeed, health informatics (or healthcare IS) has become a key focus of healthcare providers, insurance companies, and governments. now, many doctors carry laptops or tablets, allowing them to digitally store any diagnosis, facilitating the sharing of information between the physician, nurses, and even your medical insurance provider. In addition to providing access to electronic patient records, the laptop or tablet provides your physician access to medical and drug information, as offered by the Prescriber's Digital Reference website (  https://www .pdr.net  ), where your physician can obtain the latest information about drugs and clinical guidelines or check interactions between different drugs.

Information systems have also tremendously changed the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. For example, modern electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) devices heavily depend on computer technology, and, as the name implies, computed tomography (used to produce images of internal organs) could not be performed without computer technology. Even diagnostic tests such as X-rays use digital technology, allowing the doctor to digitally enhance the image for improved diagnosis or to electronically transmit the image to a remote specialist. Following the diagnosis of a serious condition, technology can even help in the operating room. For example, many modern clinics use surgical robots and endoscopes for delicate procedures such as neurosurgery or gastrointestinal surgery. Taken a step further, such systems can be used for what is referred to as telemedicine, including remote diagnosis and remote surgery. Whereas traditionally a patient had to travel thousands of miles to visit a specialized surgeon, many surgeries can now be performed remotely, reducing the strain on the patient and potentially saving precious time. Further, telemedicine applications can be used for remote locations, battlefields, or even prisons, reducing costs for transporting patients and improving care.

Just as physicians, insurance companies, and healthcare providers are turning to information systems to improve business processes and better serve patients' needs, consumers are increasingly using the internet for health information. For example, WebMD is one of the most popular websites providing health-related information, priding itself on having high-quality, timely, and unbiased information. In addition to objective information, people use social media to obtain information beyond what is published by the experts. Specifically, people seeking physician and hospital rankings or recommendations frequent blogs, health-related discussion forums, or review sites such as RateMDs (  https://ratemds .com  ) or Angie's list (  https://angieslist.com  ). Further, major search engines are constantly refining their search algorithms to provide the most relevant information to health-related queries. Another important trend is the use of personal sensors, devices, and services to keep track of a variety of things about your health and well-being. For example, there are numerous products to help you quantify various aspects of your life, from Wi-Fi-connected body scales and fitness trackers to mood monitoring, blood testing, sleep monitoring, and even DnA sequencing. The Internet of Things is playing a huge role in fueling various aspects of the quantified self , a movement to incorporate data acquisition on various aspects of a person's daily life to chart self-improvement and other objectives. These and other data sources throughout the digital world are creating massive amounts of data that can be used by researchers to better understand various healthrelated issues. likewise, doctors and hospitals are increasingly using IoT-enabled healthcare devices, and healthcare providers are using data analytics for everything from researching drug interactions to monitoring healthcare costs, quality of

service, and effectiveness of treatments. needless to say, Big Data and analytics are transforming the healthcare industry.

Regardless of whether you're visiting your doctor about a condition or for a routine checkup or if you need more information about what your doctor is telling you, various information systems are likely to play a major role.

## Key Points Review

1. Describe the need for business intelligence, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence and how databases serve as a foundation for making better business decisions. Businesses need to quickly respond to external threats and opportunities arising from unstable market conditions, fierce competition, short product life cycles, government regulation, or fickle customers; business intelligence and advanced analytics tools can help organizations gain meaningful insights from ever-increasing amounts of structured and unstructured data. Likewise, artificial intelligence tools can augment or replace human decision making. Organizations use databases to capture and manage the data that can later be used as input to business intelligence applications. A database is a collection of related data organized in a way that facilitates data searches and contains entities, attributes, records, and tables. A DBMS is a software application with which you create, store, organize, and retrieve data from a single database or several databases. The data within a database must be adequately organized so that it is possible to store and retrieve data effectively. To support more effective business processes, businesses use online transaction processing. Data from operational systems serve as an input to informational systems. Master data management helps organizations to arrive at a 'single version of the truth' to gather business intelligence; data warehouses and data marts support the integration and analysis of large data sets.
2. Explain core concepts of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence. Business intelligence tools enable business users to analyze past and current data to obtain an understanding of what has happened. Traditionally,

decision support systems were used to support human and automated decision making. OLAP tools offer the ability to perform complex multidimensional queries. Visualization refers to the display of complex data relationships using a variety of graphical methods. Results of complex analyses as well as key performance indicators are displayed on digital dashboards, which are often used to provide decision makers with the right information in an easy-tounderstand way. Visual analytics combines the human visual system and analysis techniques to aid in the analysis of complex relationships and make sense of 'noisy' data. Advanced analytics tools, in contrast, are used by business users as well as business analysts and data scientists to gain a deeper understanding of why things happened and to build predictive models. Advanced analytics models are often used to discover 'hidden' relationships in data. Data mining is used for association discovery and clustering and classification. Unstructured data analysis is used to extract information from textual documents. Intelligent systems, based on machine learning and artificial neural networks, work to emulate and enhance human capabilities.

3. Describe how organizations can enhance decision making by using knowledge management and geographic information systems. Knowledge management systems are a collection of technologybased tools that enable the generation, storage, sharing, and management of tacit and explicit knowledge assets. GISs aid in storing, analyzing, and managing geographically referenced data and provide spatial decision support for a variety of applications.

## Spreadsheet Application: Travel Loan Facility

6-  42.

A new aspect of the business has been added to Campus Travel. Students can apply for a loan to help pay for their travels. However, loans for travel are available only to students who are traveling outside the country for at least 2 weeks. Because the costs for this type of international travel differ depending on how you travel, where you stay, and what you do at the destination, different loan packages are available. For a month in Europe, you have decided to take out a loan. You have already taken a look at several offers but are unsure whether you can afford it. Set up a spreadsheet to calculate the payments per month for the following situations:

- ■ 2 weeks in Eastern Europe; price: US$2,000; interest rate: 5.5%; Time: 1 year
- ■ 2 weeks in Western Europe; price: US$3,000; interest rate: 6.0%; time: 1 year

- ■ 3 weeks in Western Europe; price: US$3,500; interest rate: 5.5%; time: 2 years
- ■ 4 weeks in Eastern Europe; price: US$4,000; interest rate: 6.0%; time: 2 years
- ■ 4 weeks in Western Europe; price: US$5,000; interest rate: 6.5%; time: 2 years

Once you have calculated  the  payments,  calculate  the total amount to be paid for each option as well as the total interest you would pay over the course of the loan. Make sure to use formulas for all calculations and submit a  professionally  formatted  page  displaying  the  results and a page displaying the formulas. (Hint: In Microsoft Excel, use the 'PMT' function in the category 'Financial' to calculate the payments.

## Net Stats: Internet User Demographics Around the World

While over the past years, internet user demographics have shifted toward a broader user base, there are still differences among  different  segments  of  society.  Globally,  there  are about 5 billion users with internet access as of March 2021. In  the  United  States,  studies  conducted  by  Pew  Research show that 93 percent of adults use the internet, and this use is almost even among males and females. About 94 percent of the male population and 93 percent of the female population use the internet. In terms of age groups, the findings show that  99  percent  of  people  in  the  18-29  age  group  use  the internet compared to 98 percent of people between the ages of 30-49. On the other hand, only 75 percent of people aged 65+ use the internet. The research also shows that, 99 percent of those with a household income of $75,000 or higher used the internet, whereas only 86 percent of those with a household income of $30,000 or less used the internet. This

## CASE 1 MI6: Intelligence Services Take to the Cloud

In 2021, Richard Moore, the head of the British intelligence service MI6, tweeted that the service was looking for a new head of technology. But this was no search for the next inventor of a shoe phone or pen that can fire bullets. The candidate MI6 needed  would  have  many  managerial responsibilities, and instead of cyanide pills and exploding pencils, they would be dealing with computers and algorithms.

threats to national security. Though formed in 1909, it was during the Second World War that MI6 received this more popular label, derived from the section number of a British military intelligence service.

The tweet shows how much the world of spying and intelligence-gathering has changed since the Cold War. To the general public, the name MI6 will likely conjure up scenes from James Bond films, yet the character is firmly rooted in the old days of Secret Intelligence Service, which is its actual name. MI6 is not the only British intelligence service; MI5 deals with domestic threats and espionage within the United Kingdom, while MI6 deals with foreign

MI6 was very active during the World Wars and the Cold War, but its existence was an official secret until 1994. These days, the service is rather more forthcoming about itself. It is now officially acknowledged, for instance, that the headquarters of the service is in Vauxhall, London. It is perhaps a reflection of how the espionage game has changed that there is now even a website where people interested in working for MI6 can look up potential careers at the service.

One of the new core areas of focus is 'cyber,' defined as 'promoting and defending the UK's cyber realm and using cyber expertise to reduce threats.' In a rare public speech, Richard Moore, the head of MI6, stressed the importance of this objective by citing, as an example, the hacking of Solar Winds, an IT firm in the United States. The hack took place in 2020 and was masterminded, according to the U.S. government, by a foreign state, and it had enormous consequences not only for global giants like Microsoft but also for many firms in the United Kingdom. The list of cyberattacks is, of course, vast. In the same year, hackers attacked the systems of British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in an attempt to obtain information on the vaccine it was developing against COVID-19. In 2021, the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom was hacked, forcing them to reconfigure its network from scratch. The exact extent of the damage done remains unknown, but the British press described it as significant.

To increase its digital capabilities, British security services took an unprecedented

step in 2021 by signing a contract with Amazon to use their cloud services. Critics blasted this decision on the grounds that sensitive information and state secrets were now being transferred to a corporation, and a non-British one at that. Government officials  stressed  that  the  contract  would increase the efficiency of divisions like MI6; what those advantages are was, perhaps fittingly for a secret service, never made very clear. But experts outside MI6 say that the move would allow information to be processed  more  quickly,  in  days  or  hours instead of weeks, and that it would also be easier for MI6 to use tools like speech recognition. Many of these experts also pointed to the fact that MI6 is underfunded and needed outside help for such digital activities; in the 1990s, for instance, its budget was slashed by 25 percent. Additionally, security measures have been implemented so the data are stored in the United Kingdom and Amazon as a company will not have access to them. Nor is it uncommon for British government agencies to have cloud storage contracts with companies from outside the country; Google, for example, was already being used by several agencies to store data.

Defending  against  cyberattacks  is hardly the British intelligence services' only digital interest. In 2016 these services were given greatly enhanced surveillance powers in the Investigatory Powers Act. The bill, which was highly controversial in the United Kingdom and soon received the moniker 'the Snooper's Charter,' was described by the British government as intended to protect the United Kingdom from threats, digital or otherwise. However, the bill may have given Parliament's sanction to activities MI6 was already engaged in, and not only against the systems of socalled 'enemy states.' In 2013, for example,  the  systems  of  Belgian  telecom provider  Belgacom  were  hacked.  As always, in such cases it is difficult to be completely sure who the culprit was, but according to Edward Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency employee and whistleblower, the hack was the work of British intelligence services. An official Belgian enquiry backed this conclusion. Allegedly, the objective of the hack was not Belgacom itself but a subsidiary company that had data related to phone traffic in, for instance, the Middle East and Africa.

## CASE 2 Gathering Social Intelligence

In recent years, social media have become pervasive throughout society. No one can deny that social media have completely changed the context of privacy, shaping and reshaping relationships, exaggerating ideals of sharing, and reconstructing daily routines in order to visit one's online friends at least once a day. Thanks to social media, people can now share every detail about the most mundane things in life. Updating where you are at any given moment alerts your friends to  what  you  are  up  to  but  also  allows enterprises to learn how to better market products and promote celebrities.

Responding to the growing influence of social media and, in turn, demonstrating another crucial function of the phenomenon, all types of organizations are finding value in monitoring and digesting the nonstop flow of posts in the social media world. For example, traditional business intelligence (BI) will inform you where your products are selling well and where they are not.  But  it  will  not  tell  you why your

In the digital age, new information-gathering methods have been just as transformative  for  the  spy  business  as  hacking. Investigative consortia such as Bellingcat have outdone 'traditional' spies by obtaining information from open source data. Facebook accounts, manuals, blogs-there is a wealth of information available on the internet for those who know where to look. Bellingcat has thus been able to extensively document what has been happening on battlefields in conflict areas such as Syria and Yemen. This information-gathering requires a considerable workforce and very specific skills that traditional spies do not necessarily have-another reason why MI6 is willing to step outside its usual boundaries and seriously contemplate cooperation with state-of-the-art private technology firms.

There is, however, a glimmer of hope for 'traditional' spies. According to Moore, information-gathering through contacts in other countries will always be part and parcel of the spying business. Hence, even in the future, there will be a need for agents like James Bond-but they probably need to study data science before applying for the job.

product is selling well in one location but not another. By integrating social media with traditional BI tools, you can monitor everything that is being said about your products on various platforms. With such social intelligence, you can gain deeper and more timely insights about customers, learning why a product is not selling. As we all know, information can travel fast on social media sites, as information goes viral when people like, share, and retweet information. By carefully monitoring trends,

companies can stay ahead of the competition as new information is starting to trend. Countless successful organizations are actively monitoring social media to gain social intelligence regarding the sentiments of current and future customers.

Social media has not only become an important source of up-to-date information for businesses, but it is also emerging as a valuable resource for police and other first responders. Social media users have demonstrated that information about crises can travel at a rate that rivals 911 services. Indeed, analyzing public information is not unusual  in  the  world  of  intelligence gathering, either. Today, social media have people racing to express who they are and what they think, information that has never been this vast and openly accessible. Using such information, the U.S. government is developing tools to forecast everything from revolutions to upheavals to economic changes. Recently released documents also reveal  that  the  U.S.  National  Security Agency (NSA) uses Facebook and other social media profiles to create maps of social connections. From business corporations  to  government agencies, insights about what is happening, or about to happen, can be gleaned from social media

Have  you  checked  your  Facebook newsfeed today? Or, more accurately, how many times have you been on Facebook since you woke up this morning? It is astonishing to see what a large part of our lives social media have become. By just keeping an eye on the number of posts your feed gets in an hour, you can easily imagine how analyzing these massive numbers of posts can quickly become a Big Data problem. On the other hand, gaining social intelligence has become a Big Data opportunity for countless organizations.
