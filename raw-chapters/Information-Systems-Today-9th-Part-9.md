## Developing and Acquiring Information Systems

## Preview

As  you  have  read  throughout  this  book  and  have experienced in your own life, information systems and technologies  are  of  many  different  types,  including high-speed  web  servers  to  rapidly  process  customer requests, business intelligence systems to aid   managerial decision making, customer relationship management systems to provide improved customer service, and   mobile apps to provide the core services  of  the    organization. Given this variety, when we refer to 'systems' in this chapter, we are talking about a broad range of technologies, including hardware, software, and services. Just as there are different types of systems, there are different approaches for developing and acquiring them. If you are a business student majoring in areas such as marketing, finance, accounting, or management, you might be wondering why we have a discussion about developing and acquiring information systems. The answer is simple: No matter what area of an organization you are in, you will be involved in systems development or technology acquisition processes. In fact, research indicates that spending on systems in many organizations is controlled by the specific business functions rather than by the information systems (IS) department. What this means is that even if your career interests are in something other than information systems, it is very likely that you will be involved in the development and acquisition of systems, technologies, or services. On the other hand, you may even develop a great idea for a tech startup with a team of fellow students and may have to consider how to develop and deploy the necessary systems. Understanding these processes is important to your future success.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## The Maker Movement

I n the past, building and delivering a product used to require  a  substantial  support  infrastructure.  Physical products  required  machine  tools,  injection  molding machines, and substantial space for manufacturing, inventory,  and  fulfillment.  The  digital  components  required large teams of developers with highly specialized skills. Recent innovations have led to a dramatic shift in these requirements. Today, individuals and small groups can  participate  in  the  full  cycle  of  product  innovation much more readily. This trend toward an increase in doit-yourself  (DIY)  and  do-it-with-others  (DIWO)  is  often referred to as the 'maker movement' and participants as  'makers.'  Key  technologies  that  have  enabled  the maker movement are inexpensive and small computing devices,  rapid  prototyping  machinery,  and  streamlined software development platforms.

Small,  inexpensive  computing  devices  like  the  Raspberry  Pi  Zero-a  device  costing  as  little  as  $5  that  can

perform all the functions of a full-scale computer-have made  processing  power  more  available  and  flexible. The low cost allows more people access (e.g., schools can now afford to supply their students with their own computers). The small size and flexibility allow for many more possible uses-the Raspberry Pi Zero is about the size of a credit card and can be integrated into everything from school projects to Internet of Things (IoT) devices to designer clothing. Low-cost rapid prototyping machines have given makers the ability to bring their imagination to life. An object that may have previously required expensive custom machine tools to manufacture can be printed on a relatively affordable desktop 3D printer, which uses techniques like fused deposition modeling  to  directly  create  parts  from  computerized designs. 3D printers can even print other 3D printers!

The  software  side  has  seen  a  similar  shift.  The Raspberry Pi has a large community devoted to making coding easier and more accessible. Online retailer SparkFun designs various open source microcontroller boards and sensors that provide the basis for developing innovative software and products that utilize data from  embedded  sensors  and  other  microelectronics. The use of open source hard- and software and standard interfaces makes it easy for anyone to learn and develop code to support their own devices.

Maker spaces are physical locations designed to facilitate such innovation. In addition to making resources such as 3D printers available to individuals and teams, maker spaces provide access to other innovators and makers. Someone with a great IoT idea and a hardware design  but  without  coding  skills  can  get  connected

with someone to fill in the gaps. These collaborative environments are enabling innovation on a scale never seen  before,  such  that  today,  anyone  can  be  a  software and hardware engineer. Makers across the globe dramatically showed their collaborative spirit by their collective  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Makers rapidly iterated on urgently needed ventilators and personal  protective  equipment  designs  (e.g.,  masks, face shields), and provided those designs to any maker willing to 'print' to meet local healthcare needs.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

1. How can makers formulate and present the business case for selecting various hardware and software platforms?
2. How can makers ensure that they successfully complete their development projects?
3. How can makers decide which components to create themselves and which to obtain externally?

## Making the Business Case

Before people are willing to spend money to acquire or develop a new system or spend more money on an existing one, they want to be convinced that this will be a good investment. Making the business case refers to the process of identifying, quantifying, and presenting the value provided by a system.

## Business Case Objectives

What does making the business case mean? Think for a moment about what defense lawyers do in court trials. They carefully build a strong, integrated set of arguments and evidence to prove that their clients are innocent to those who will pass judgment on their clients. In much the same way, a manager must build a strong, integrated set of arguments and evidence to prove that an information system (or any type of investment) is adding value to the organization or its constituents. This is, in business lingo, 'making the business case' for a system.

As a business professional, you will be called on to make the business case for systems and other capital investments, you will have to make the case for a new system or application you may need for your work to improve certain business processes, or you will be involved in evaluating the business case for a proposed system. Thus, as a finance, accounting, marketing, or management professional, you are likely to be involved in these processes and will, therefore, need to know how to effectively make or evaluate the business case for a system (or other capital expenditures) and need to understand the relevant organizational issues involved. It will be in the organization's best interest-and in your own-to ferret out systems that are not adding value. In these cases, you will need to either improve the systems or replace them. Traditionally, business units turned to IS departments for new systems or applications. Today, business units often directly purchase applications from outside vendors and expect these applications to function in the infrastructure provided by the IS departments. As more and more applications are purchased from external vendors, organizations must make sure to go through a proper process in selecting the right applications.

Making the business case is as important for proposed systems as it is for the continued investment in an existing system. For a proposed system, the case will be used to determine whether the new system is a 'go' or a 'no-go.' For an existing system, the case will be used to determine whether the company will continue to fund the system. Whether a new system or an existing one is being considered, your goal is to make sure that the investment adds value, that it helps the firm achieve its strategy and competitive advantage over its rivals, and that money is being spent wisely.

## The Productivity Paradox

Unfortunately, while it is easy to quantify the costs associated with developing an information system, it is often difficult to quantify tangible productivity gains from its use. Over the past several years, the press has given a lot of attention to the impact of IS investments on worker productivity. In many cases, IS expenditures, salaries, and the number of people on the IS staff have all been rising, but results from these investments have often been disappointing. For instance, the  information  and  technology  research  firm  Gartner  (2020)  forecast  that  worldwide  spending on systems and technologies would reach US$3.9 trillion in 2020. American and Canadian companies are spending, on average, about 4 percent of company revenues on system-related investments. As a result, justifying the costs for IS investments has been a hot topic among senior managers at many firms. 'White-collar' productivity, especially in the service sector, has not increased at the rate one might expect, given the trillions of dollars spent.

Why has it been difficult to show that these vast expenditures on technologies have led to productivity gains? Have information systems somehow failed us, promising increases in performance and productivity and then failing to deliver on that promise? Determining the answer is

not easy. Information systems may have increased productivity, but other forces may have simultaneously worked to reduce it, the end results being difficult to identify. Factors such as government regulations, more complex tax codes, stricter financial reporting requirements (such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; see Chapter 10, 'Securing Information Systems'), and more complex products can all have major impacts on a firm's productivity.

It is also true that information systems introduced with the best intentions may have had unintended consequences. A paramount example is giving employees access to email and the internet; now employees are spending excessive amounts of time surfing the web to check sports scores on ESPN.com, read volumes of electronic junk mail received from internet marketing companies or from personal friends, post status updates on social networking sites, or use company PCs to download and play software games (Figure 9.2). Recently, it was reported that 89 percent of surveyed employees admitted 'wasting time' at work; most wasted an hour or less, but 4 percent admitted wasting more than half the workday on non-work-related activities including doing personal work as well as visiting social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Whereas some distractions can help clear one's mind and boost productivity, uncontrolled use of social media during worktime (sometimes called 'cyberloafing') costs billions of dollars in lost productivity every year. In such situations, information systems can result in less efficient and less effective communication among employees and less productive uses of employee time than before the systems were implemented. Nevertheless, sound technology investments should increase organizational productivity. If this is so, why have organizations not been able to show larger productivity gains? Several reasons have been given for the apparent productivity paradox of technology investments (Figure 9.3). The four most prominent factors are examined next.

MEASUREMENT PROBLEMS. In many cases, the benefits of information systems are difficult to pinpoint because firms may be measuring the wrong things. Often, the biggest increases in productivity result from increased effectiveness (i.e., the extent to which goals or tasks are accomplished well). Unfortunately, many business metrics focus on efficiency (i.e., the extent to which goals are accomplished faster, at lower cost, or with relatively little time and effort).

A good example of measurement problems associated with a technology investment is the use of online banking. How much has online banking contributed to banking productivity? Traditional statistics might look at the adoption rate of the service and associated reductions in branch-based services and locations. While informative, such statistics may not work well for evaluating online banking, at least at this time. For instance, some older customers may not want to bank online, so a reduction in the number of traditional branches could threaten a potentially large number of very good customers while at the same time inflating the percentage of online banking users (i.e., if the number of traditional banking customers leave the bank because of a reduction of branches, the adoption rate of online customers as a percentage will be increased). So, investing in online banking may be unimportant for an important segment of customers while essential for others. Nevertheless, can you imagine a bank staying competitive without offering online services? Deploying technologies such as online banking has become a strategic necessity -something an organization must do to survive (see Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems'). The value of necessary investments is often difficult to quantify.

Unintended consequences can limit the productivity gains from IS investments.

TIME LAGS. A second explanation for why productivity is sometimes difficult to demonstrate for some technology investments is that there may be significant time lags between a company making an investment and observable impacts on the bottom line. Let us return to our online banking example. In some markets, it may take years from the first implementation of this new system before the magnitude of benefits may be felt by the organization.

REDISTRIBUTION. A third possible explanation for why IS productivity figures are not always easy to define is that a new type of system may be beneficial for individual firms but not for a particular industry or the economy as a whole. Particularly in competitive situations, new innovations may be used to redistribute the pieces of the pie rather than making the whole pie bigger. The result for the industry or overall economy is a wash-that is, the same number of products are being sold, and the same number of dollars are being spread across all the firms.

MISMANAGEMENT. A fourth explanation is that the new system has not been implemented and managed well. Some believe that people often simply build bad systems, implement them poorly, and rely on technology fixes when the organization has problems that require a joint technology/ process solution. Rather than increasing outputs or profits, IS investments might merely be a temporary bandage and may serve to mask or even increase organizational inefficiency. Also, as we mentioned in Chapter 2, an information system can be only as effective as the business model that it serves. Bad business models cannot be overcome by good information systems.

If it is so difficult to quantify the benefits of information systems for individual firms and for entire industries, why do managers continue to invest in information systems? The answer is that competitive pressures force managers to invest in information systems whether they like it or not. Also, for many organizations, information systems are an important source of competitive advantage. You might ask, then, why waste time making the business case for a system? Why not just acquire or develop it? The answer: Given limited resources on the one hand and the vast number of potential systems and technologies that could be selected on the other hand, a strong business case aids the decision-making process and helps direct resources in more strategic ways.

## Making a Successful Business Case

People make a variety of arguments in their business cases for information systems. When managers make the business case for an information system, they typically base their arguments on faith, fear, and/or facts (Wheeler &amp; Marakas, 1999). (Wheeler also adds a fourth F for fiction and notes that, unfortunately, managers sometimes base their arguments on pure fiction, which is not only bad for their careers but also not at all healthy for their firms.) Table 9.1 shows examples of these three types of arguments.

TABLE 9.1 Three Types of Arguments Commonly Made in the Business Case for an Information System

| Type of Argument   | Description                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Faith              | Arguments based on beliefs about organizational strategy, competitive advantage, industry forces, customer perceptions, market share, and so on | 'I know I don't have good data to back this up, but I'm convinced that having this customer relationship management system will enable us to serve our customers significantly better than our competitors do and, as a result, we'll beat the competition... You just have to take it on faith.' |
| Fear               | Arguments based on the notion that if the system is not imple- mented, the firm will lose out to the competition or, worse, go out of business  | 'If we don't implement this mobile app, we'll get killed by our competi- tors because they're all implementing mobile apps . . . We either do this or we die.'                                                                                                                                    |
| Facts              | Arguments based on data, quan- titative analysis, and/or indis- putable factors                                                                 | 'This analysis shows that implement- ing the inventory control system will help us reduce errors by 50 percent, reduce operating costs by 15 percent a year, and increase production by 5 percent a year and will pay for itself within 18 months.'                                               |

Do not assume that you must base your business case on facts only. It is entirely appropriate to base the business case on faith, fear, or facts (Figure 9.4). Indeed, the strongest and most convincing business case will include a little of each type of argument. In the following sections, we talk about each of these types of arguments for the business case.

BUSINESS CASE ARGUMENTS BASED ON FAITH. In some situations, arguments based on faith (or fear) can be the most compelling and can drive the decision to invest in an information system despite the lack of any hard data on system costs or even in the face of some data that say that the dollar cost for the system will be high. Arguments based on faith often hold that an information system must be implemented to achieve the organization's strategy effectively and to gain or sustain a competitive advantage over rivals.

For example, a firm has set as its strategy that it will be the dominant global force in its industry. As a result, this firm must adopt a variety of collaboration technologies to enable employees from different parts of the globe to work together effectively and efficiently. Similarly, a firm that has set as its strategy a broad scope-producing products and services across a wide range of consumer needs-may need to adopt some form of an enterprise resource planning system to better coordinate business activities across its diverse product lines.

## Project Natick-Microsoft's Underwater Data Centers

A data center is a specially designed facility to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunication and data storage systems. Data centers are typically huge facilities, with countless data centers around the world being larger than 1 million square feet. In 2019, the China Telecom Data Center in Hohhot, China, was the largest data center in the world with a floor size of 10.7 million square feet. Because of their massive size, data centers are often located in remote locations.

Each data center can provide computer processing and storage for billions of individuals and millions of companies. Some of the biggest data centers are the backbone for the largest tech companies such as facebook, Google, microsoft, and Apple. These data centers, with millions of computers, produce a tremendous amount of heat and require an equal amount of cooling to keep machines and equipment from overheating. many centers are located near fresh water, such as the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where Google, microsoft, and facebook have massive facilities. These centers use millions of gallons of water from the river to keep the facility cool and the computers from overheating; massive pumps are used to cycle the water from the river into the facility and then to outdoor cooling ponds before moving the water back into the river.

feet under water in the oceans around the world. much of the world's population lives in urban centers off the coasts of the world's oceans. Placing the data centers underwater closer to most of the world's users will speed up data access, utilize sustainable energy from tidal turbines, and virtually reduce cooling costs to zero. Because an ocean is so huge, there is literally no heat impact from the data center on the surrounding environment. However, building a self-contained data center that can resist the corrosive elements of the sea as well as operate for up to 5 years without maintenance remains the most challenging aspect of this project. Nevertheless, Project Natick may be the future of how data centers are constructed to both reduce the massive footprint of current data centers and help to reduce the energy requirements and environmental impacts of the digital world.

In short, successful business case arguments based on faith should clearly describe the firm's mission and objectives, the strategy for achieving them, and the types of information systems that are needed to enact the strategy. A word of caution is warranted here. In today's business environment, cases based solely on strategic arguments, with no hard numbers demonstrating the value of the information system under consideration, are not likely to be funded.

BUSINESS CASE ARGUMENTS BASED ON FEAR. There are several different factors to consider when making a business case containing arguments based on fear. These include different factors involving competition and other characteristics of the industry in which the firm operates. For example, a mature industry, such as the automotive industry, may need systems simply to maintain the current pace of operations. While having the newest systems and technologies available may be nice, they may not be essential to stay in business. However, a company in a newer, expanding industry, such as the green technology industry, may find it more important to be on the leading edge of technology to compete effectively in the marketplace. Likewise, some industries are more highly regulated than others. In these cases, companies can use technology investments to better control processes and ensure compliance with appropriate regulations. The argument for the business case here would be something like 'If we do not implement this system, we run the risk of being sued or, worse, being thrown in jail'   (see   Chapter   10  )  .

Probably the most important industry factor that can affect technology investments is the nature of competition or rivalry in the industry. For example, when competition in an industry is high and use of the newest technologies is pervasive, as it is in the mobile phone industry, strategic necessity, more than anything else, forces firms to adopt new systems. Given how tight profit margins are in this industry, Apple, Samsung, and other manufacturers must use inventory control systems, business

intelligence systems, and a host of other systems that help them to be more effective and efficient. If they do not adopt these systems, they will likely go out of business. As introduced in Chapter 2, a common way for assessing the level of competition within an industry is the five forces model (  Porter, 1979). By assessing the various competitive forces, you can determine which specific technologies may be useful. For instance, in a highly price-competitive market, where buyers have strong bargaining power, investments to reduce production costs might be advantageous. Business case arguments formulated this way sound something like 'If we do not implement this system, our competitors are going to beat us on price, we will lose market share, and we will go out of business.'

BUSINESS CASE ARGUMENTS BASED ON FACTS. Many people, including most chief financial officers, want to see the business case for an information system based on a convincing, quantitative analysis that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the benefits of the system will outweigh the costs. The most common way to prove this is to provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the information system. Although this step is critical, the manager must remember that there are inherent difficulties in and limits to cost-benefit analyses for information systems. To illustrate how a cost-benefit analysis could be used to build a fact-based business case, let us consider the development of a web-based order entry system for a relatively small firm.

Identifying Costs One goal of a cost-benefit analysis is to accurately determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) for an investment. TCO is focused on understanding not only the total cost of acquisition but also all costs associated with ongoing use and maintenance of a system. Consequently, costs can usually be divided into two categories: non-recurring costs and recurring costs . Non-recurring costs are one-time costs that are not expected to continue after the system is implemented. These include costs for things such as site preparation and technology purchases. These one-time costs may also include the costs of attracting and training a webmaster or renovating some office space for new personnel or for hosting the web servers. Non-recurring costs such as for the acquisition or upgrade of long-term physical assets such as equipment and buildings are often classified as a capital expenditure .

Recurring costs are ongoing costs that occur throughout the life of the system. Recurring costs include the salary and benefits of the webmaster and any other personnel assigned to maintain the system, electricity, upgrades and maintenance of the system components, monthly fees paid to a local internet service provider, and the continuing costs for the space in which the webmaster works or the data center where the servers reside. Such recurring costs are typically classified as a non-capital expenditure (or operational expenditure ). Personnel costs are usually the largest recurring costs, and the web-based system is no exception in this regard. These recurring expenses can go well beyond the webmaster to include expenses for customer support, content management, ongoing maintenance, and more.

The sample costs described thus far are tangible costs that are relatively easy to quantify. Some intangible costs ought to be accounted for as well, even though they will not fit neatly into the quantitative analysis. These might include the costs of reduced traditional sales, losing some customers that are not 'web ready,' or losing customers if the web application is poorly designed or not on par with competitors' sites. You can choose to either quantify these in some way (i.e., determine the cost of losing a customer) or simply reserve these as important costs to consider outside of-but along with-the quantitative cost-benefit analysis.

Identifying Benefits Next, you determine both tangible benefits and intangible benefits . Some tangible benefits are relatively easy to determine. For example, you can estimate that the increased customer reach of the new web-based system will result in at least a modest increase in sales. Based on evidence from similar projects, you might estimate, say, a 5 percent increase in sales the first year, a 10 percent increase the second year, and a 15 percent increase the third year. In addition, you might also include as tangible benefits the reduction of order entry errors because orders will now be tracked electronically and shipped automatically. You could calculate the money previously lost on faulty and lost orders along with the salaries and wages of personnel assigned to find and fix these orders and then consider the reduction of these costs as a quantifiable benefit of the new system. Cost avoidance is a legitimate, quantifiable benefit of many systems. Similarly, the new system may enable the company to use fewer order entry clerks or redeploy these personnel to other, more important functions within the company. You could consider these cost reductions as benefits of the new system.

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Harvesting Human Energy

If you have a smartwatch or a fitness tracker, it is frustrating that you can deplete your battery within a few days or less; likewise, you probably must recharge your phone at least once a day. for any electric or electronic device, be it a mobile phone, a laptop computer, or an electric vehicle, battery life continues to be the Achilles' heel. To overcome this problem, researchers are exploring how to power our gadgets, such as our smartwatches and fitness trackers, by our body movements. The idea of generating energy from human body movements is not new; already at the beginning of the 20th century, watchmakers developed self-winding (mechanical) watches that used natural body movements to wind the watch. What is new is the idea of translating bending movements into energy to charge electronic gadgets. Researchers have developed a simple mechanism that attaches to the knee and can be used by mountaineers or others that often find themselves away from reliable power sources. The mechanism does not require additional effort to be expended, yet it translates human movement into enough energy to power many types of wearable and GPS devices. most of these types of devices require relatively low amounts of power; utilizing movement energy could effectively address the catastrophic inability to power a GPS device in a remote location. for devices that require more energy, such as devices connected to smartphones via Bluetooth, this approach could greatly extend the device's need for recharging by days or even weeks. While there are many challenges before the technology can be commercialized, one that is particularly difficult to forecast is the reliability of our movements. Those who are fitness fanatics will have no problem keeping their gadgets charged. for couch potatoes, this approach will have limited value. Nevertheless, powering your gadgets by your movements is on the horizon. Want to Dm your friends on Twitter? Take a walk!

A web-based system may have intangible benefits as well. Some intangible benefits of this new system might include improvements in customer service resulting from faster turnaround on fulfilling orders. These are real benefits, but they might be hard to quantify with confidence. Perhaps an even more intangible benefit would be the overall improved perception of the firm. Customers might consider it more progressive and customer service-oriented than its rivals; in addition to attracting new customers, this might increase the value of the firm's stock if it is a publicly traded firm. Another intangible benefit might be simply that it was a strategic necessity to offer customers web-based ordering to keep pace with rivals. While these intangibles are difficult to quantify, they must be considered along with the more quantitative analysis of benefits. In fact, the intangible benefits of this web-based system might be so important that they could carry the day despite an inconclusive or even negative cost-benefit analysis.

Performing Cost-Benefit Analyses An example of a simplified cost-benefit analysis that contrasts the total expected tangible costs versus the tangible benefits is presented in   Figure 9.  5  . Notice the large investment up front, with another significant outlay in the fifth year for a system upgrade. You could now use the net costs/benefits for each year as the basis of your conclusion about this system. Alternatively, you could perform a break-even analysis -a type of cost-benefit analysis used to identify at what point (if ever) tangible benefits equal tangible costs (note that break-even occurs early in the second year of the system's life in this example)or a more formal net-present-value analysis of the relevant cash flow streams associated with the system at the organization's discount rate (i.e., the rate of return used by an organization to compute the present value of future cash flows). In any event, these cost-benefit analyses help you make the business case for this proposed web-based order fulfillment system. It clearly shows that the investment for this system is relatively small, and the company can quickly recapture the investment. In addition, there appear to be intangible strategic benefits to deploying this system. These analyses-and the accompanying arguments and evidence-go a long way toward convincing senior managers in the firm that this new system makes sense. For more on cost-benefit analyses, see any introductory finance or managerial accounting textbook.

Comparing Competing Investments One method for deciding among different IS investments or when considering alternative designs for a given system is weighted multicriteria analysis , as illustrated in   Figure   9.  6  . For example, suppose that for a given application being considered for purchase, there are three alternatives that could be pursued-A, B, or C.

Let's also suppose that early planning meetings identified three key system requirements and four key constraints that could be used to help decide on which alternative to pursue. In the left column of Figure 9.6, three system requirements and four constraints are listed. Because not all requirements and constraints are of equal importance, they are weighted on the basis of their relative importance. In other words, you do not have to weight requirements and constraints equally; it is certainly possible to make requirements more or less important than constraints. Weights are arrived at in discussions among the analysis team, users, and managers. Weights tend to be fairly subjective and,

Decisions about alternative projects or system design approaches can be assisted using a weighted multicriteria analysis.

for that reason, should be determined through a process of open discussion to reveal underlying assumptions followed by an attempt to reach consensus among stakeholders. Notice that the total of the weights for both the requirements and constraints is 100 percent.

Next, each requirement and constraint is rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A rating of 1 indicates that the alternative does not meet the requirement very well or that the alternative violates the constraint. A rating of 5 indicates that the alternative meets or exceeds the requirement or clearly abides by the constraint. Ratings are even more subjective than weights and should also be determined through open discussion among users, analysts, and managers. For each requirement and constraint, a score is calculated by multiplying the rating for each requirement and each constraint by its weight. The final step is to add up the weighted scores for each alternative. Notice that we have included three sets of totals: for requirements, for constraints, and for overall totals. If you look at the totals for requirements, alternative B or C is the best choice because each meets or exceeds all requirements. However, if you look only at constraints, alternative A is the best choice because it does not violate any constraints. When we combine the totals for requirements and constraints, we see that the best choice is alternative C. Whether alternative C is actually chosen for development, however, is another issue. The decision makers may choose alternative A because it has the lowest cost, knowing that it does not meet two key requirements. In short, what may appear to be the best choice for a systems development project may not always be the one that ends up being developed or acquired. By conducting a thorough analysis, organizations can greatly improve their decision-making outcomes.

Total Economic Impact Assessing a system's return on investment purely by costs and benefits is not well suited for situations where information systems are used strategically, as traditional metrics (such as TCO) leave out aspects such as the flexibility a system offers in the future or the risk associate with a system. Consequently, Forrester devised the Total Economic Impact (TEI) methodology, which contains four components, namely, the impact on IT (i.e., project cost), the impact on the business (i.e., business benefits), future options created (i.e., future flexibility), as well as the associated risks or uncertainty associated with the new system. Thus, the future options component includes aspects such as flexibility or scalability, which are often essential for strategic information systems.

## Presenting the Business Case

Up to this point, we have discussed the key issues to consider as you prepare to make the business case for a system. We have also shown you some tools for determining the value that a system adds to an organization. Now you are ready to make the case-to present your arguments and evidence to the decision makers in the firm.

KNOW THE AUDIENCE. Depending on the firm, several people from various areas of the firm might be involved in the decision-making process. People from different areas of the firm typically hold very different perspectives about what investments should be made and how those investments should be managed (Table 9.2). Consequently, presenting the business case for a new system

investment can be quite challenging. Ultimately, various factors come into play in making investment decisions, and numerous outcomes can occur (Figure 9.7). For instance, decisions and choices are driven by perceived needs, resource availability, evaluation criteria, and so on. Numerous outcomes can occur from this decision process. Of course, the project can be accepted or rejected; often, projects can be conditionally accepted or flagged for revision to more fully consider resource, time, or other constraints. Understanding the audience and the issues important to them is a first step in making an effective presentation. V arious ways to improve the development of a business case are examined next.

CONVERT BENEFITS TO MONETARY TERMS. When making the case for an IS investment, it is desirable to translate all potential benefits into monetary terms. For example, if a new system saves department managers an hour per day, try to quantify that savings in terms of dollars. Figure 9.8 shows how you might convert time savings into dollar figures. While merely explaining this benefit as 'saving managers' time' makes it sound useful, managers may not consider it a significant enough inducement to warrant spending a significant amount of money. Justifying a US$50,000 system because it will 'save time' may not be persuasive enough. However, an annual savings of US$90,000 is more likely to capture the attention of decision makers and is more likely to result in project approval. Senior managers can easily rationalize a US$50,000 expense for a US$90,000 savings and can easily see why they should approve such a request. They can also more easily rationalize their decision later if something goes wrong with the system.

DEVISE PROXY VARIABLES. The situation presented in Figure 9.8 is fairly straightforward. Anyone can see that a US$50,000 investment is a good idea because the return on that investment is US$90,000 the first year. Unfortunately, not all cases are this clear-cut. In cases in which it is not as easy to quantify the impact of an investment, you can come up with proxy variables (i.e., alternative measures of outcomes) to help clarify what the impact on the firm will be. Proxy variables can be used to measure changes in terms of their perceived value to the organization. For example, if mundane administrative tasks are seen as low-value activities (perhaps a 1 on a

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## Ethical App Development

In the past, systems development was in the hands of large software companies, with large development teams and legal departments that would scrutinize new functionalities for legal and ethical compliance. With the advent of the smartphone and social media came the promise of getting rich quick by developing the next facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest, or some other killer app. Nowadays, it's not only large companies building those apps but individuals with a creative idea aided by easy-to-use development tools.

However, with the hope of developing the next killer app, ethical implications are often overlooked or outright ignored, as evidenced by uKnowKids, the provider of the world's first 'Parental Intelligence System.' While uKnowKids was designed to help parents track their children, lack of proper security resulted in the app leaking a huge database of nearly 7 million text messages, 2 million images (many depicting children), and 1,700 in-depth child profiles. uKnowKids shuttered in early 2020 and has since referred their customers to Bark, a service that uses artificial intelligence to monitor and protect children from online predators.

## Questions

1. mobile phones provide the possibility to collect various data about the user. Assume that you are developing a new weather app and are considering collecting user data that you don't need right away but may need in the future to build a different app. Is this practice ethical? What types of data would you be comfortable collecting? Which would you not consider collecting? Why?
2. you know that your competitors' apps are collecting much more data than you do, potentially giving them an advantage today or at some time in the future. Should you follow their lead and collect more data about your customers? Why or why not?

In addition to sloppy app development, mobile devices offer various tempting ways of collecting user data, with many apps requesting access to functionalities such as your contacts, location, camera, microphone, and so on. Given these vulnerabilities and the abilities for developers to sneak their true intent past app store publishing guidelines, a new code of conduct for app development is needed. Just because you can collect certain types of data, should you? many argue that an app should only be allowed to collect and utilize data it needs to provide its functionality, nothing more. Developers should also carefully consider the consequences of  personal  data  being  compromised.  Who  would  be affected, and how serious might the consequences be? Given the high value of your personal data, the maxim of the app development industry should be: 'Even though you can, don't collect data unless absolutely necessary!'

5-point scale) but direct contact with customers is seen as a high-value activity (a rating of 5), you can use these perceptions to indicate how new systems will add value to the organization. In this example, you can show that a new system will allow personnel to have more contact with customers while, at the same time, reducing the administrative workload. Senior managers can quickly see that individual workload is being shifted from low-value to high-value activities.

You can communicate these differences using percentages, increases or decreases, and so on-whatever best conveys the idea that the new system is creating changes in work, performance, and the way people think about their work. This gives decision makers some relatively solid data on which to base their decision.

MEASURE WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO MANAGEMENT. One of the most important things you can do to show the benefits of a system is one of the simplest: Measure what senior managers think is important. You may think this is trivial advice, but you would be surprised how often people calculate impressive-looking statistics in terms of downtime, reliability, and so on,

only to find that senior managers disregard or only briefly skim over those figures. You should concentrate on the issues senior business managers care about. The 'hot-button' issues with senior managers should be easy to discover, and they are not always financial reports. Hot issues with senior managers could include cycle time (how long it takes to process an order), regulatory or compliance issues, customer feedback, and employee morale. By focusing on what senior business managers believe to be important, you can make the business case for systems in a way that is more meaningful for those managers, which makes selling systems to decision makers much easier. Managers are more likely to buy in to the importance of systems if they can see the impact on areas that are important to them. Now that you understand how to make the business case for new information systems, we next examine the development process.

## The Systems Development Process

No matter if a software company such as Microsoft is planning to build a new version of its popular Office software suite or if a company such as Netflix is trying to build a system to improve its movie recommendations, companies need to decide which development approach to follow. The process of designing, building, and maintaining information systems is often referred to as systems analysis and design . Likewise, the individual who performs this task is referred to as a systems analyst . Because few organizations can survive without effectively utilizing information and computing technology, the demand for skilled systems analysts is very strong. Organizations want to hire systems analysts because they possess a unique blend of managerial and technical expertise-systems analysts are not just 'techies.' Systems analysts remain in demand precisely because of their unique blend of abilities.

## Custom Versus Off-the-Shelf Software

When deciding to deploy new systems to support their operations to gain or sustain a competitive advantage, organizations can typically choose between custom and off-the-shelf software. For example, many types of application software (such as word processors, spreadsheet, or accounting software) can be used by a variety of businesses within and across industries. These types of general-purpose systems are typically purchased off the shelf. Often, however, organizations have very specific needs that cannot be met by generic technologies. This is especially true for companies trying to capitalize on a first-mover advantage and therefore unable to purchase a preexisting system to meet their specific needs. For example, pioneers in online retailing (such as Amazon) or ride sharing (such as Uber or Lyft) needed entirely new systems and technologies to support their revolutionary business models and had to develop (or have someone else develop) custom solutions. Likewise, mobile apps often need to be developed from scratch. The approaches to developing or acquiring custom and off-the-shelf software are quite different, but they also have many similarities. Before going into the details of developing or acquiring such systems, we'll first contrast these two types of systems.

CUSTOM SOFTWARE. Custom software is developed to meet the specifications of an organization (it is thus also sometimes called tailor-made or bespoke software ). Such software may be developed (or configured) in-house by the company's own IS staff, or the development may be contracted, or outsourced, to a specialized vendor charged with developing the system to the company's contractual specifications. Custom software has two primary advantages over general purpose commercial technologies:

1. Customizability. The software can be tailored to meet unique organizational requirements. Such requirements, for example, can reflect a desire to achieve a competitive advantage through a specific type of system (e.g., Uber's apps for drivers and riders); to better fit business operations, characteristics of the organizational culture, or proprietary security requirements; or to better interface with existing systems. Further, company- or industryspecific terms or acronyms can be included in a new software application, as can unique types of required reports. Such specificity is not typically possible in off-the-shelf systems that are targeted at a more general audience.
2. Problem Specificity. The company pays only for the features specifically required for its users. In contrast to software packages such as Microsoft Office, which include a wide range of individual programs (some of which may never be used), only those components that are really needed can be implemented.

Today, building a complete system from scratch is quite rare; most information systems that are developed within an organization for its internal use typically include many preprogrammed, reusable modules that are purchased from development organizations or consultants.

OFF-THE-SHELF SOFTWARE. Although custom software has advantages, it is not automatically the best choice for an organization. Off-the-shelf software (or packaged software) is typically used to support common business processes that do not require any specific tailoring. In general, off-the-shelf systems, whether hardware or software, are less costly, faster to procure, of higher quality, and less risky than custom systems. Table 9.3 summarizes examples of off-the-shelf application software.

Traditionally, the most common option for packaged software was so-called commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software; this type of software is typically developed by software companies that spread the development costs over a large number of customers. An alternative to commercial off-the-shelf software is open source software.

## Open Source Software

Open source is a philosophy that promotes developers' and users' access to the source of a product or idea. Particularly in the area of software development, the open source movement has taken off with the advent of the internet; people around the world are contributing their time and expertise to develop or improve software, ranging from operating systems to application software. As the programs' source code is freely available for use and/or modification, this software is referred to as open source software . Open source software owes its success to the inputs from a large user base, helping to fix problems or improve the software. One of the great success stories of open source software is the Android operating system. As of May 2020, Android's share of the global smartphone shipment market-led by Samsung products-was over 70 percent! Android is based on another open source operating system called Linux, developed as a hobby by the Finnish university student Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux has since become the operating system of choice for web servers, embedded systems (such as set-top boxes and network routers), and supercomputers alike (between June 1998 and November 2017, the share of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers running Linux operating systems has increased from 0.2 to 100 percent [Top 500, 2019]). In addition to the Linux operating system, other open source software has been gaining increasing popularity because of its stability and low cost. For example, in May 2020, 36 percent of all websites were powered by nginx (pronounced 'engine x') and 25.5 percent of all websites were powered by the Apache web server, two open source projects (Netcraft, 2020).

Open source projects have also become indispensable for Big Data initiatives ranging from storing and managing vast amounts of unstructured data to analyzing these data. Not only do open source applications provide the tools to deal with Big Data, the openness of the source code also helps instill confidence as to where the results come from. Today, many Big Data startups, but also established companies from Adobe to Yahoo!, use Hadoop, a framework for distributed processing of large-scale data sets. For example, the oil company Chevron turned to the open source project Hadoop for storing and managing huge amounts of seismic data needed to locate oil or gas deposits on the ocean floor. Other popular examples of open source application

software include the Firefox web browser and the office productivity suite Apache OpenOffice; likewise, parts of the search engine DuckDuckGo are open source as well.

How do large open source projects such as Firefox work? Typically, contributors suggest modifications for changes; for example, they contribute to program code or provide new designs for the system's user interface; a small group of carefully selected 'committers' can then test and implement these modifications into the official releases of the software to ensure the quality and stability of the software.

While there are many benefits to open source software, vendors of proprietary software are still highlighting 'hidden' costs of running open source software, such as obtaining reliable customer support. On the other hand, however, commercial open source vendors are providing customer support, installation, training, and so on, to their paying customers. Men's Wearhouse, the State of Oregon, and many other large organizations use a CRM system offered by SugarCRM, Inc., a commercial open source vendor that offers free 'community editions' as well as other, more feature-rich paid editions of its software. Similarly, the popular MySQL database, which is used by Facebook, GitHub, Verizon Wireless, and many other companies, is provided under an open source license for personal use, but the company employs its own developers and offers commercial licenses (including dedicated 24/7 technical support, consulting, and indemnification clauses) to business users. Further, many open source projects are now backed by major information technology (IT) companies such as IBM, which give money and human resources to Linux projects, or Oracle, which donated the source code of the OpenOffice productivity suite to the Apache Software Foundation. While in the early 2000s, Microsoft actively fought open source projects, it has now turned into the biggest contributor to open source projects; in early 2020, Brad Smith-the company's president-openly acknowledged that Microsoft had been wrong about open source.

## Systems Integration: Combining Custom, Open Source, and Off-the-Shelf Systems

The process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally to act as a coordinated whole is referred to as systems integration (see Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World'). Organizations can perform this integration themselves or hire experts who are well versed in weaving together various technologies into an integrated solution. Systems integration is an important skill because it allows an organization to bring together cheaper, preconfigured components and off-the-shelf software to meet business needs rather than having to pursue the more expensive approach of building a customized system from scratch.

Through systems integration, it is possible to combine the unique advantages of custom, open source, and commercial off-the-shelf systems into an integrated solution. For example, an online retailer may want to purchase an off-the-shelf inventory management system and then add tailor-made modules it needs to conduct its day-to-day business. This system could be based on the open source database MySQL; further, the online retailer could use the open source Apache web server to power its online shopping site. In some cases, for example, with large ERP systems, companies selling off-the-shelf software make customized changes for a fee. Other vendors, however, may not allow their software to be modified (as is the case with generic, all-purpose software, such as Microsoft Office).

Commercial off-the-shelf systems are almost always acquired from an external vendor, whereas custom systems can be either developed in-house or developed by an outside vendor (Figure 9.9). Regardless of the source of the new system-custom, open source, or off-the-shelfthe primary role of managers and users in the organization is to make sure that it will meet the organization's business needs. This may be especially important in the case of end users developing systems. End users typically do not program elaborate systems but frequently use spreadsheet or database software to create solutions for accomplishing narrow, well-defined tasks; while such applications may be useful for accomplishing certain tasks, end user development may cause problems related to the adherence to standards, lack of documentation, security concerns, or a lack of continuity if the employee who built the spreadsheet or database leaves the organization.

## IS Development in Action

The tools and techniques used to develop information systems are continually evolving with the  rapid  changes  in  IS  hardware  and  software.  In  discussing  tools  and  techniques,  we  will first  focus  on  structured  methodologies  that  are  primarily  used  for  large  projects  with  stable requirements,  before  discussing  agile  methodologies,  which  have  become  popular  for  developing   customer-facing systems with unclear or changing requirements. As you will see, using

## FIGURE 9.9

There are a variety of sources for information systems.

## FIGURE 9.10

Problem decomposition makes solving large, complex problems easier.

<!-- image -->

structured methodologies is a fairly disciplined process that moves from step to step. Systems analysts become adept at decomposing large, complex problems into many small, simple problems. The goal of the systems analyst is to design the final system by piecing together many small software modules and technologies into one comprehensive system (Figure 9.10). For example, think about using LEGO TM  blocks for building a model of a space station. Each individual block is a small, simple piece that is nothing without the others. When put together, the blocks can create a large and very complex design (Google co-founder Larry Page had gained some notoriety for building a working printer out of LEGO™ bricks). When systems are built in this manner, they are much easier to design, build, and, most important, maintain.

Although many people in organizations, such as managers and users, are responsible and participate in a systems development project, the systems analyst has primary responsibility. Some projects may have one or several systems analysts working together, depending on the size and complexity of the project. The primary role of the systems analyst is to study the problems and needs of an organization to determine how people, methods, and information technology can best be combined to bring about improvements in the organization. A systems analyst helps systems users and other business managers define their requirements for new or enhanced information systems.

A systems analyst typically also manages the development project. As the project manager , the systems analyst needs a diverse set of management, leadership, technical, conflict management, and customer relationships skills. The project manager is the person most

<!-- image -->

responsible for ensuring that a project is a success. The project manager must deal with continual change and problem solving. Successful projects require effective resource and task management as well as effective communication as the project moves through its various steps. Project management is an important aspect of the system development or acquisition process and a critical skill for successful systems analysts. The focus of project management is to ensure that projects meet customer expectations and are delivered within budget and time constraints. Clearly, a systems analyst is an agent of change and innovation in modern organizations.

## The Role of Users in the Systems Development Process

Many organizations have a huge investment in transaction processing and management information systems. These systems are most often designed, constructed, and maintained by systems analysts  within  the  organization  using  a  variety  of  methods. When  building  and  maintaining information systems, systems analysts rely on information provided by system users, who are involved in all phases of the system's development process. To effectively participate in the process, it is important for all members of the organization to understand what is meant by systems development and what activities occur. A close, mutually respectful working relationship between analysts and users is key to project success.

## Systems Development Controls

In any systems development or acquisition process, it is key to ensure that all systems (including hardware and software) are properly developed, acquired, and maintained. Following a structured systems development process helps minimize threats arising from software bugs, security holes, or other issues. A software bug is an error or flaw in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result or to behave in unintended ways. As it is close to impossible to develop complex software without bugs, companies frequently offer significant 'bug bounties' to outsiders who discover critical bugs. In general, systems development controls should ensure that the necessary security features are implemented and enabled and that proper change management processes are followed. When acquiring systems from outside vendors, organizations face risks not only from software bugs but also from backdoors (such as default administrator passwords) that may exist in the system. Thus, organizations should exercise due diligence to ensure that the software is trustworthy (e.g., by reviewing the software's source  code  (if  possible)  and  by  performing  background  checks  on  the  vendor's  history  and trustworthiness).  In  all  cases,  these  processes  should  be  properly  documented  to  establish  an audit trail that allows tracing back who reviewed, authorized, implemented, or tested the systems.

## Steps in the Systems Development Process

Just as the products that a firm produces and sells follow a life cycle, so do organizational information systems. For example, a new type of tennis shoe follows a life cycle of being designed, introduced to the market, being accepted into the market, maturing, declining in popularity, and ultimately being retired. The term systems development life cycle (SDLC) describes the life of an information system from conception to retirement (Valacich &amp; George, 2020). The SDLC has four primary phases:

1. Systems planning and selection
2. Systems analysis
3. Systems design
4. Systems implementation and operation

Figure 9.11 is a graphical representation of the SDLC containing four boxes connected by arrows. Within the SDLC, arrows flow from systems planning and selection, to systems analysis, to systems design, and, finally, to systems implementation and operation. Once a system is in operation, it moves into an ongoing maintenance phase that parallels the initial development process. For example, when new features are added to an existing system, analysts must first plan and select which new features to add, then analyze the possible impact of adding these features to the existing system, then design how the new features will work, and, finally, implement these new features into the existing system. While some consider maintenance another SDLC phase, it is really a repeated application of the core SDLC phases. In this way, the SDLC becomes an ongoing cycle . During ongoing systems maintenance, the entire SDLC is followed to implement system repairs and enhancements.

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Malicious Software Development

There seems to be a never-ending stream of security threats. Each year, new vulnerabilities and threats are created (see   Table   9.  4  ). Ransomware is holding people's data hostage. Online dating (e.g., Ashley madison, Heyyo, mobifriends, OkCupid) data breaches have broken many hearts. Each leakage of nude photos of celebrities results in a near meltdown of the internet. As individuals and organizations increasingly rely on information systems and gadgets, the stakes are increasingly higher. In 2019 alone, nearly 8 billion user records were stolen by cyber thieves. Examples of such records include people's health data, social media credentials, finance and banking accounts, detailed records of the background checks of virtually all U.S. governmental employees, and countless others.

How can this happen? Creators of legitimate as well as malicious software engage in systems development activities. most (if not all) legitimate software contains vulnerabilities (or security holes). The reasons for this are manifold: increasing complexity of software makes it all but impossible to build a flawless system, developers may try to rush the product to market and neglect proper testing procedures, security holes are introduced if change management procedures are not properly followed, or inexperienced developers may not be aware of the need for proper security measures. Cybercriminals try to discover these vulnerabilities and engage in systems development activities to build malicious software (i.e., threats) that exploit the vulnerabilities. T ypically, cybercriminals use sophisticated software tools to discover the vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability is discovered, the process of creating the malware follows the systems development approaches discussed in this chapter; first, the criminals will need to analyze the requirements, then design and implement the software, and finally test its efficacy. The number of security incidents signals that, in many cases, the criminals are successful. And what's truly troubling is there is no end in sight. Experts believe that with increasing digital density, things are going to get worse before they get better. Given this dismal forecast, everyone needs to remain vigilant to best secure their online digital lives.

## Phase 1: Systems Planning and Selection

The first phase of the SDLC is systems planning and selection (see Figure 9.11). Understanding that it can work on only a limited number of projects at a given time because of limited resources, an organization must take care that only those projects that are critical to enabling the organization's mission, goals, and objectives are undertaken. Consequently, the goal of systems planning and selection is simply to identify, plan, and select a development project from all possible projects that could be performed. Organizations differ in how they identify, plan, and select projects. Some organizations have a formal information systems planning process whereby a senior manager, a business group, an IS manager, or a steering committee identifies and assesses all possible systems development projects that the organization could undertake. Project managers present the business case for the new system, and it is accepted or rejected. Others follow a more ad hoc process for identifying potential projects. Nonetheless, after all possible projects are identified, those deemed most likely to yield significant organizational benefits, given available resources, are selected for subsequent development activities.

Just as there are often differences in the source of systems projects within organizations, there are often different evaluation criteria used within organizations when classifying and ranking potential projects, such as strategic alignment, costs and benefits, resource availability, project size and duration, or technical difficulties and risks. During project planning, the analyst works with the customers-the potential users of the system and their managers-to collect a broad range of information to gain an understanding of the project size, potential benefits and costs, and other relevant factors. After collecting and analyzing this information, the analyst builds the business case that can be reviewed and compared with other possible projects. If the organization accepts the project, systems analysis begins.

## Phase 2: Systems Analysis

The second phase of the SDLC is called systems analysis (see Figure 9.11). One purpose of the systems analysis phase is for designers to gain a thorough understanding of an organization's current way of doing things in the area for which the new information system will be constructed. The process of conducting an analysis requires that many tasks, or subphases, be performed. The first subphase focuses on determining system requirements. To determine the requirements, an analyst works closely with users to determine what is needed from the proposed system. After collecting  the  requirements,  analysts  organize  this  information  using  data,  process,  and  logic modeling tools.

COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS. The collection and structuring of requirements is arguably the most important activity in the systems development process because how well the IS requirements are defined influences all subsequent activities. The old saying 'garbage in, garbage out' very much applies to the systems development process. Requirements collection is the process of gathering and organizing information from users, managers, customers, business processes, and documents to understand how a proposed information system should function. Systems analysts

The SDLC defines the typical process for building systems.

<!-- image -->

use a variety of techniques for collecting system requirements, including the following (Valacich &amp; George, 2020):

- ■ Interviews. Analysts interview people informed about the operation and issues of the current or proposed system.
- ■ Questionnaires. Analysts design and administer surveys to gather opinions from people informed about the operation and issues of the current or proposed system.
- ■ Observations. Analysts observe system users at selected times to see how data are handled and what information people need to do their jobs.
- ■ Document Analysis. Analysts study business documents to discover issues, policies, and rules as well as concrete examples of the use of data and information in the organization.
- ■ Joint Application Design. Joint application design (JAD) is a group meeting-based process for requirements collection (Figure 9.12). During this meeting, the users jointly define and agree on system requirements or designs. This process can result in dramatic reductions in the length of time needed to collect requirements or specify designs.

Business analysts use structured languages to describe how the system should behave. An example of such language is Gherkin, which uses a limited number of keywords such as SCENARIO, GIVEN, WHEN, THEN, AND, or BUT to describe a system's intended behavior. For example, the paywall feature of a newspaper could be written as follows:

SCENARIO: Christoph tries to access an article.

GIVEN: I am logged in as Christoph,

AND: my account is active,

WHEN: I try to access an article,

THEN: I should be redirected to the article.

Requirements written in a structured language can be parsed by automated tools, which allow, for example, tracing requirements or creating automated testing routines.

MODELING DATA. In organizations, data are used to describe people, objects, or events. A lot of different data can be used to describe a person: name, age, gender, race, and occupation, among others. To construct an information system, systems analysts must understand what data the information system needs to accomplish the intended tasks. To do this, they use data modeling tools to collect and describe the data to users to confirm that all needed data are known and presented to users as useful information. Figure 9.13 shows an entity-relationship diagram, a type of data model describing students, classes, majors, and classrooms at a university. Each box in the diagram is referred to as a data entity, and each entity is related to other entities. Data modeling tools enable the systems analyst to represent data in a form that is easy for users to understand and critique. For more information on databases and data modeling, see the Technology Briefing.

<!-- image -->

MODELING PROCESSES AND LOGIC. The next step in this phase is to model how data are being input, processed, and presented to the users. As the name implies, data flows represent the movement of data through an organization or within an information system. For example, your registration for a class may be captured in a registration form on paper or in an interactive form on the web. After it is filled out, this form probably flows through several processes to validate and record the class registration, shown as 'Data Flows' in Figure 9.14. After all students have been registered, a repository of all registration information can be processed for developing class rosters or for generating student billing information, which is shown as 'Data' in Figure 9.14. Processing logic represents the way in which data are transformed. Processing logic is often expressed in pseudocode , which is a representation of the program's internal functioning, independent of the actual programming language being used. As there are no standards for pseudocode, the level of detail can vary. For example, pseudocode to calculate students' grade-point averages at the conclusion of a term is shown in the 'Processing Logic' section in Figure 9.14.

After the data, data flow, and processing logic requirements for the proposed system have been identified, analysts develop one or many possible overall approaches-sometimes called designs-for the information system. For example, one approach for the system may possess only basic functionality but has the advantage of being relatively easy and inexpensive to build. An analyst might also propose a more elaborate approach for the system, but it may be more difficult and costlier to build. Analysts evaluate alternative system design approaches with the knowledge that different solutions yield different benefits and different costs. After a system design approach is selected, details can be identified and defined.

## Phase 3: Systems Design

The third phase of the SDLC is systems design (see Figure 9.11). As its name implies, it is during this phase that the proposed system is designed; that is, the details of the chosen approach are elaborated. As with analysis, many different activities must occur during systems design. The elements that must be designed when building an information system include the following:

- ■ Processing and logic
- ■ Databases and files
- ■ Human-computer interface

DESIGNING PROCESSING AND LOGIC. The processing and logic operations of an information system are the steps and procedures that transform raw data inputs into new or modified information. There are typically different ways to complete each process, with some being more

end

current\_gpa = total\_grade/total hours

efficient or effective than others. Modeling the processes thus includes specifying not only what is to be done but also the specific algorithms, which outline the steps, or set of rules, to be followed (that is, how a certain process is accomplished). For example, when calculating your grade-point average, your school needs to perform the following steps:

1. Obtain the prior grade-point average, credit hours earned, and list of prior courses.
2. Obtain the list of each current course, final grade, and course credit hours.
3. Combine the prior and current credit hours into aggregate sums.
4. Calculate the new grade-point average.

The logic and steps needed to make this calculation can be represented in many ways, including structure charts, decision trees, pseudocode, programming code, and so on (see Figure 9.14). Regardless of how the logic is represented, the process of converting pseudocode, structure charts, or decision trees into actual program code during system implementation is a relatively straightforward process.

DESIGNING DATABASES AND FILES. To design databases and files, a systems analyst must have a thorough understanding of an organization's data and informational needs. For example, Figure 9.15 shows the database design to keep track of student information in a Microsoft Access database. The database design is more complete (shows each attribute of the student) and more detailed (shows how the information is formatted) than a conceptual data model built during systems analysis (as was shown in Figure 9.14).

DESIGNING THE HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACE. Just as people have different ways of interacting with other people, information systems can have different ways of interacting with people. A human-computer interface (HCI) is the point of contact between a system and users. With people being used to interacting with easy-to-use systems and websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon, their expectations in terms of ease of use are ever increasing. In addition, increasing a system's usability -that is, whether the system is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing-can lower error rates, increase efficiency, or increase customer satisfaction (in the case of customer-facing systems). Thus, analysts also take great care in designing data entry forms and management reports. A form is a business document containing some predefined data, often including some areas where additional data can be filled in (Figure 9.16). Similarly, a report is a business document containing only predefined data for online viewing or printing (Figure 9.17). For more on forms and reports, see Chapter 6, 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence.'

## Phase 4: Systems Implementation and Operation

Many separate activities occur during systems implementation , the fourth phase of the SDLC (see Figure 9.11). One group of activities focuses on transforming the system design into a working information system. These activities include software programming and testing. A second group of activities focuses on preparing the organization for using the new information system. These activities include system conversion, documentation, user training, and support. This section briefly describes what occurs during systems implementation.

SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING AND TESTING. Programming is the process of transforming the system design into a working computer system. During this transformation, both programming and testing should occur in parallel. As you might expect, a broad range of tests is conducted before a system is complete, including developmental testing , alpha testing , and beta testing (Table 9.5).

SYSTEM CONVERSION, DOCUMENTATION, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT. System conversion is the process of decommissioning the current way of doing things (automated or manual) and installing the new system in the organization. Effective conversion of a system requires not only that the new software be installed but also that users be effectively trained and supported. System conversion can be performed in at least four ways, as shown in Figure 9.18.

## Description

<!-- image -->

Many types of documentation must be produced for an information system. Programmers develop system documentation that details the inner workings of the system to ease future maintenance and to ensure reliability of the system. A second type of documentation is user-related documentation, which is typically written not by programmers or analysts but by users or professional technical writers. The range of documents can include the following:

- ■ User and reference guides
- ■ User training manuals and tutorials
- ■ Installation procedures and troubleshooting suggestions

In addition to documentation, users may also need training and ongoing support to use a new system effectively. Different types of training and support require different levels of investment by the organization. Self-paced training and tutorials are the least expensive options, and one-on-one training is the most expensive. Table 9.6 summarizes various user training options.

Besides training, providing ongoing education and problem-solving assistance for users may also be necessary. This is commonly referred to as system support, which is often provided by a special group of people in the organization who make up an information center or help desk. Support personnel must have strong communication skills and be good problem solvers in addition to being expert users of the system. An alternative option for a system not developed internally is to outsource support activities to a vendor specializing in technical system support and training. Regardless of how support is provided, it is an ongoing issue that must be managed effectively for the company to realize the maximum benefits of a system.

| Perfective maintenance | Making enhancements to improve processing performance or interface usability or adding desired but not necessarily required system features (in other words, 'bells and whistles') |

## Repeating the SDLC: Systems Maintenance

After an information system is installed, it is essentially in the systems maintenance phase. A system does not wear out in the physical manner that cars, buildings, or other physical objects do, but it must still be systematically repaired and/or improved. The types of maintenance are summarized in Table 9.7.

During systems maintenance, it is typical that one person within the systems development group is responsible for collecting maintenance requests from system users. Periodically, these requests are analyzed to evaluate how a proposed change might alter the system and what business benefits might result from such a change, and are prioritized accordingly (Figure 9.19). As with adaptive maintenance , both perfective maintenance and preventive maintenance are typically a much lower priority than corrective maintenance , which deals with repairing flaws in the system. Corrective maintenance is most likely to occur after initial system installation as well as over the life of a system after major system changes. This means that adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance activities can lead to corrective maintenance activities if they are not carefully designed and implemented.

As with developing or acquiring new systems, any changes to an existing system need to be carefully managed. Unmanaged changes can have a variety of negative consequences, including

<!-- image -->

system malfunction, system failure, increasing unreliability (as errors tend to build up over time, making the system more fragile), or opening the door for fraud or deliberate misuse (e.g., if a 'backdoor' is introduced during changes to a system). If a change request is approved, the system change is designed and then implemented. As with the initial development of the system, implemented changes need to be formally reviewed and tested before being installed into operational systems. Thus, change request management is a formal process that ensures that any proposed system changes are documented, reviewed for potential risks, appropriately authorized, prioritized, and carefully managed (to establish an audit trail that allows tracing back who reviewed, authorized, implemented, or tested the changes). In other words, the systems maintenance process parallels the process used for the initial development of the information system, as shown in Figure 9.20. Interestingly, it is often during system maintenance that the largest part of the system development effort occurs.

Today, vendors of commercial off-the-shelf software packages incorporate patch management systems to facilitate the different forms of systems maintenance for the user; patch management systems use the internet to check the software vendor's website for available patches and/or updates. If the software vendor offers a new patch, the application will download and install the patch to fix the software flaw. An example of a patch management system in wide use is the Windows Update Service, which automatically connects to a Microsoft web service to download critical operating system patches for corrective maintenance (e.g., to fix bugs in the Windows operating system) or preventive maintenance (e.g., to fix security holes that could be exploited by malicious hackers).

As you can see, there is more to systems maintenance than you might think. Lots of time, effort, and money are spent in this final phase of a system's development, and it is important to follow prescribed, structured steps. In fact, the approach to systems development described here-from the initial phase of identifying, selecting, and planning for systems to the final phase of systems maintenance-is a very structured and systematic process. Each phase is fairly well prescribed and requires active involvement by systems people, users, and managers.

## Other Approaches to Designing and Building Systems

The SDLC is one approach to managing the development process, and it is a very good approach to follow when the requirements for the information system are highly structured and straightforward (e.g., for a payroll or inventory system). Today, in addition to 'standard' systems such as payroll and inventory systems, organizations need a broad variety of company-specific information systems, for which requirements either are very hard to specify in advance or are constantly changing. For example, an organization's website is likely to evolve over time to keep pace with changing business requirements. How many websites have you visited in which the content or

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Mobile Cybercrime

Whenever you look into your email, you are likely to see malicious messages intended to trick you into giving away sensitive information-such as your bank account number or login credentials-or install malicious software on your computer   (see   Chapter   10  )  . In many cases, sophisticated spam filters recognize the malicious intent, automatically route such messages into a spam folder, and disable hyperlinks to malicious websites, thus protecting the user. In other cases, there are telltale signs that signal something fishy (e.g., phishing messages mimicking that of a bank may contain multiple spelling or grammatical errors, hyperlinks pointing to  non-bank  domains,  or  missing  name  or  account numbers).

leaked by hackers. Besides the login credentials, it is unclear if the app store's payment information was breached, which could result in further consequences for the affected users. Unfortunately, Android users are not alone with the risks presented by untrusted app stores, as the popular process of jailbreaking (i.e., removing Apple's restrictions to customizations and untrusted app stores) iPhones is easier than ever before. Of course, there are legitimate reasons for both Android and iPhone users to bypass their platform's trusted app stores, but is it worth the risk?

However, other types of malicious software may be more difficult to detect, especially with mobile devices now being ubiquitous. In particular, mobile users who install apps from untrusted sources (i.e., outside of trusted app stores that perform various security scans on listed apps) are not only at greater risk of installing mobile malware, but are also at greater risk of weak untrusted app store security protections. In 2020, the Android third-party app store Aptoide was breached, resulting in more than 20 million login credentials

Thus, as a mobile user, you are not immune from security issues, but you can make decisions to decrease your risk. The easiest way to protect yourself is to only install the apps you need, and do so from your trusted app store.

For this type of system, the SDLC might work as a development approach, but it would not be optimal.

PROTOTYPING. Prototyping , which uses a trial-and-error approach for discovering how a system should operate, is often used when requirements are unclear, and/or feedback from the client is needed. You may think that this does not sound like a process at all; however, prototyping is used extensively in different situations. For example, prototyping is an integral part of new product design, where different prototypes of various fidelity are built during the design process; based on the feedback received (e.g., in terms of aesthetics or ergonomics), revised prototypes are built before the final design is decided upon. In the early stages, prototypes are used to demonstrate the concepts on a high level; the design is then iteratively refined and, over time, the prototypes will become ever closer to the final product.

Figure   9.  21 diagrams the prototyping process when applied to identifying/determining system requirements. To begin the process, the system designer interviews one or several users of the system, either individually or as a group, in a JAD session. After the designer gains a general understanding of what the users want, he or she develops a prototype of the new system as quickly as possible to share with the users. The users may like what they see or ask for changes. If the users request changes, the designer modifies the prototype and again shares it with them. This process of sharing and refinement continues until the users approve the functionality of the system. In developing software, early (low-fidelity) prototypes can take the form of 'paper prototypes,' where a mockup of a user interface is hand-drawn on a piece of paper; as the requirements become clearer, the designer creates prototypes with higher fidelity to obtain more detailed feedback. This helps the user obtain a better understanding of the requirements and get a feel of the system before the final software is coded. Early prototypes are usually throw-away prototypes that will not become part of the final system, but prototyping software used for high-fidelity prototypes can generate code to facilitate building the final software product. Note that prototyping as a methodology is often used to complement structured approaches such as the SDLC. Likewise, the minimum viable products created when following the lean startup approach are a form of prototypes, in that they are built rapidly and are used to quickly obtain feedback from potential customers.

AGILE METHODOLOGIES. The SDLC follows a strict sequence and is very good for large projects with dozens or more developers as well as for problems where the system's requirements are well understood. However, as outlined in Chapters 1 and 2, information systems are at the heart of many companies' competitive advantage; further, large and small organizations face increasing competition from nimble startups, and for many systems required to stay ahead of the competition, requirements cannot easily be defined, and often change quickly. Consequently, organizations turn to alternative approaches to the SDLC. An agile methodology utilizes an evolutionary systems development approach that focuses on creating small, client-approved parts of the system as the project progresses rather than delivering one large application at the end of the project. As such, agile methodologies (e.g., Crystal, Kanban, Scrum, and eXtreme Programming) aim to deliver valuable products with a focus on the customer; in other words, quality is the overarching goal, with time, scope, and budget becoming constraints. Whereas in traditional (predictive) life cycles (such as the SDLC) requirements are fixed at the beginning of the project, agile methodologies follow an iterative development approach, where the system quickly evolves and improves over a series of iterations, or sprints, that allow for obtaining rapid feedback from customers. At the beginning of the project, the intended features of the system are prioritized to develop the product backlog (a list of features, ranked by importance). Each iteration then focuses on a small set of these features, starting with the most important ones, so that each iteration results in a working increment of the final software. Each sprint thus has its own analysis, design, building, testing, and deployment activities that inform the subsequent sprint (see Figure 9.22).

Proponents of agile methodologies argue that methodologies adapted from engineering, like the SDLC, generally do not fit well with many real-world software development problems (Valacich &amp; George, 2020). In engineering disciplines, such as civil engineering, requirements tend to be very well understood. Once the creative and difficult work of design is completed, construction becomes very predictable and may account for as much as 90 percent of the total project effort. For software, on the other hand, requirements are rarely well understood, and they typically change during the software development process. With software, system construction may account for as little as 15 percent of the total project effort, with design constituting as much as 50 percent. Techniques that work well for predictable, stable projects, such as constructing a stretch of road, tend not to work as well for fluid, design-heavy projects such as writing new types of software. What is needed are methodologies that embrace change and that are

<!-- image -->

## FIGURE 9.22

Agile methodologies evolve using an iterative development approach.

able to deal with a lack of predictability. While agile methodologies are not for every project, they are highly recommended under the following conditions:

- ■ Unpredictable or dynamic requirements
- ■ Responsible and motivated developers
- ■ Customers who understand the process and will get involved

With the focus being on valuable software, agile approaches have some unique key characteristics. First, rather than delegating development to a single organizational unit, agile methodologies employ self-managing teams; typically including three to nine members, these cross-functional teams often include designers, developers, and members from the business, marketing, or even legal departments. Co-location of team members allows for rapid development cycles. Second, in addition to the team members, agile teams include a product owner; typically from the business side, the product owner interacts with the different stakeholders and decides on the different features to be developed in each iteration. Third, agile methodologies such as Scrum include a few key events during each sprint. At the beginning of each sprint, a sprint planning meeting is used to decide what to focus on during the sprint. Next, during each sprint, daily standups are held to discuss both the goals for the current day as well as any challenges faced during the previous day. At the end of each sprint, a sprint review is used to demonstrate the completed iteration and obtain feedback, and a sprint retrospective is used to discuss the process itself, with a focus on improving processes for the next sprint. Whereas co-location is typically seen as essential for successful agile projects, always-on videoconferences and other communication tools are being increasingly used for distributed agile teams. For more on agile approaches, see Schneider, Fuller, Valacich &amp; George (2020).

In addition, IS projects are increasingly managed using a DevOps approach, which focuses on the collaboration between engineers from development and operations, not only during the development of a system, but throughout its entire life cycle. By tightly integrating the two 'camps,' organizations can improve quality and reliability of the software, while at the same time becoming more agile and innovative.

## Acquiring Information Systems

We have now explained some of the general approaches that organizations follow when building systems in-house with their own IS staff. In many situations, however, this is not a feasible solution. The following are four situations in which you might need to consider alternative development strategies.

- ■ Situation 1: Limited IS Staff. Often, an organization does not have the capability to build a system itself. Perhaps its development staff is small or deployed on other activities and does not have the capability to take on an in-house development project.
- ■ Situation 2: IS Staff Has Limited Skill Set. In other situations, the IS staff may not have the skills needed to develop some types of systems. This has been especially true with the explosive growth of the web and mobile devices; many organizations are having outside groups develop and manage their websites and mobile apps.
- ■ Situation 3: IS Staff Is Overworked. In some organizations, the IS staff may simply not have the time to work on all the systems that the organization requires or wants.
- ■ Situation 4: Problems with Performance of IS Staff. Earlier in this book, we discussed how and why systems development projects could sometimes be risky. Often, the efforts of IS departments are derailed because of staff turnover, changing requirements, shifts in technology, or budget constraints. Regardless of the reason, the result is the same: another failed (or flawed) system.

When it is not possible or advantageous to develop a system in-house, organizations are pursuing two popular options:

1. External acquisition of a prepackaged system
2. Outsourcing systems development

These options are examined next.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## User Interface Design Inconsistency Leads to Suicide

There is more to software development than just coding, data, and other hardware and software related decisions that are made by the team of developers and analysts working on a project. Some, such as the late Steve Jobs, might argue that the user interface and user experience-what we, as users, actually use-is critically important. Jobs was famously quoted as saying, 'design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.' In other words, if the interface does not accurately represent or display the appropriate information to the user, then the user experience will not be successful.

In June of 2020, a user of a popular online stock trading firm Robinhood was tragically affected by the design decisions integrated into Robinhood's user interface. It has been reported that Alex Kearns, an amateur stock trader, committed suicide after seeing a substantial negative balance (more than US$730,000) on his Robinhood account. While there are other factors that may have led to Kearns' decision, he had been trading risky options (bull put spread) that resulted in the display of a significant, yet temporary, negative balance. The temporary negative balance was not labeled as such to the user, and the interface design did not account for timing differences that may have resulted due to delays between when the first part of an option transaction was processed and when the second options were exercised. Unfortunately for Kearns, he acted on incomplete information provided by Robinhood's inconsistent interface design, as the temporary balances and option transactions had not yet been finalized.

## External Acquisition

Purchasing an existing system from an outside vendor such as IBM, Oracle, or SAP is referred to as external acquisition . How does external acquisition of an information system work? Think about the process that you might use when buying a car. Do you simply walk into the first dealership you see, tell them you need a car, and see what they try to sell you? You had better not. You have probably done some upfront analysis and know how much money you can afford to spend and what your needs are. If you have done your homework, you probably have an idea of what you want, and which dealership can provide the type of car you desire.

This upfront analysis of your needs can be extremely helpful in narrowing your options and can save you a lot of time. Understanding your needs can also help you sift through the salespeople's hype that you are likely to encounter from one dealer to the next as each tries to sell you on why his or her model is perfect for you. After getting some information, you may want to take a couple of promising models for a test drive, actually getting behind the wheel to see how well the car fits you and your driving habits. You might even talk to other people who have owned this type of car to see how they feel about it. Ultimately, you are the one who must evaluate all the different cars to see which one is best for you. They may all be good cars; however, one may fit your needs just a little better than the others.

The external acquisition of an information system is very similar to the purchase of a car. When you acquire a new system, you should do some analysis of your specific needs. For example, how much can you afford to spend, what basic functionality is required, and approximately how many people will use the system? Next, you can begin to 'shop' for the new system by asking potential vendors to provide information about the systems that they have to offer. After you evaluate this information, it may become clear that several vendors have systems that are worth considering. You may ask those vendors to come to your organization and set up their systems so that you and your colleagues are able to 'test-drive' them. Seeing how people react to the systems and seeing how each system performs in the organizational environment can help you 'see' exactly what you are buying. By seeing the actual system and how it performs with real users,

## FIGURE 9.23

Steps in external acquisition.

with real or simulated data, you can get a much clearer idea of whether that system fits your needs. When you take a car for a test drive, you learn how the car meets your needs. By seeing how the system meets your needs before you buy, you can greatly reduce the risk associated with acquiring that system.

STEPS IN EXTERNAL ACQUISITION. In many cases, your organization will use a competitive bid process for making an external acquisition. In the competitive bid process, vendors are given an opportunity to propose systems that meet the organization's needs. The goal of the competitive process is to help the organization ensure that it gets the best system at the lowest possible price. Most competitive external acquisition processes have at least five general steps (Figure 9.23):

1. Systems planning and selection
2. Systems analysis
3. Development of a request for proposal
4. Proposal evaluation
5. Vendor selection

You have already learned about the first two steps because they apply when you build a system yourself as well as when you purchase a system through an external vendor. Step 3, development of a request for proposal, is where the external acquisition process differs significantly from in-house development.

DEVELOPMENT OF A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A request for proposal (RFP) is a document that is used to tell vendors what your requirements are and to invite them to provide information about how they might be able to meet those requirements. An RFP is sent to vendors who might potentially be interested in providing hardware and/or software for the system.

Among the areas that may be covered in an RFP are the following:

- ■ A summary of existing systems and applications
- ■ Requirements for system performance and features
- ■ Reliability, backup, and service requirements
- ■ The criteria that will be used to evaluate proposals
- ■ Timetable and budget constraints (how much you can spend)

The RFP is then sent to prospective vendors along with an invitation to present their bids for the project. Eventually, you will likely receive several proposals to evaluate. If, on the other hand, you do not receive many proposals, it may be necessary to rethink the requirementsperhaps the requirements are greater than the budget limitations or the time frame is too short. In some situations, you may first need to send out a preliminary request for information simply to gather information from prospective vendors. This will help you determine whether, indeed, the desired system is feasible or even possible. If you determine that it is, you can then send out an RFP. Often, rather than trying to identify all potential vendors and sending out RFPs, companies set up a project website, allowing potential bidders to find out more about the organization and its current and planned information systems (Figure 9.24).

PROPOSAL EVALUATION. The fourth step in external acquisition is to evaluate proposals received from vendors. This evaluation may include viewing system demonstrations, evaluating the performance of those systems, examining criteria important to the organization, and judging how the proposed systems 'stack up' to those criteria. Demonstrations are a good way to get a feel for the different systems' capabilities. Just as you can go to the showroom to look at a new car and get a feel for whether it meets your needs, it is also possible to screen various systems through a demonstration from the vendor. During a demonstration, a sales team from the vendor gives an oral presentation about the system, its features, and its cost followed by a demonstration

<!-- image -->

of the actual system. Although such demonstrations are often useful in helping you understand the features of different systems being proposed, they are rarely enough in and of themselves to warrant purchasing the system without further evaluation.

One of the methods you can use to evaluate a proposed system is systems benchmarking , which is the use of standardized performance tests to facilitate comparison between systems. Benchmark programs are sample programs or jobs that simulate a system's workload. You can have benchmarks designed to test portions of the system that are most critical to your needs, based on your systems analysis. A benchmark program might test how long it takes to run certain analytics, how long it takes to access a set of records in a database, or how long it would take to access certain information given a certain number of concurrent users. Some common system benchmarks include the following:

- ■ Time to encode a 4k video file
- ■ Time to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
- ■ Time to perform read/write operations
- ■ Time to compress or extract a file hierarchy
- ■ Time to render a complex graphic

In addition, vendors may also supply benchmarks that you can use, although you should not rely solely on vendor information. For popular systems, you may be able to rely on system benchmarks published in computer trade journals such as PC Magazine or on industry websites such as www.cnet.com. However, in most cases, demos and benchmarks alone do not provide all the information you need to make a purchase. The systems analysis phase should have revealed some specific requirements for the new system. These requirements may be listed as criteria that the organization can use to further evaluate vendor proposals. Depending on what you are purchasing-hardware, software, or both-the criteria you use will change. Table 9.8 provides examples of commonly used evaluation criteria.

VENDOR SELECTION. In most cases, more than one system will meet your needs, just as more than one car will usually meet your needs. However, some probably 'fit' better than others. In these cases, you should have a way of prioritizing or ranking competing proposals. One way of doing this is by devising a scoring system for each of the criteria and benchmarking results as described when making the business case.

Companies may use other, less formalized approaches to evaluate vendors. Sometimes they use simple checklists; other times they use a more subjective process. Regardless of the mechanism, eventually a company completes the evaluation stage and selects a vendor, ending the external acquisition process.

MANAGING SOFTWARE LICENSING. When purchasing commercial, off-the-shelf software, companies usually must agree to a license agreement. In general, software licenses can be classified based on their restrictiveness or the freedom they offer to use or modify the software.

Software licensing has been a hot-button topic for software companies as they lose billions in piracy and mislicensed customers (see Chapter 10). Traditionally, software licensing is defined as the permissions and rights that are imposed on applications; the use of software without a proper license is illegal in most countries.

Most software licenses differ in terms of restrictiveness, ranging from no restrictions at all to completely restricted. Note that, although freeware or shareware is freely available, the copyright owners often retain their rights and do not provide access to the program's source code. For organizations using proprietary software, two types of licenses are of special importance. The first type includes the shrink-wrap licenses and click-wrap licenses that accompany the software, which are used primarily for generic, off-the-shelf application and systems software. The shrink-wrapped contract has been named as such because the contract is activated when the shrink wrap on the packaging has been removed; similarly, a click-wrap license refers to a license primarily used for downloaded software that requires computer users to read through the license agreement and click on 'I accept' before installing the software. The second type of license is an enterprise license (also known as a volume license ). Enterprise licenses can vary greatly and are usually negotiated. In addition to rights and permissions, enterprise licenses usually contain limitations of liability and warranty disclaimers that protect the software vendor from being sued if its software does not operate as expected.

As shown in Table 9.9, there are a variety of software licenses. For different business needs, organizations often depend on a variety of software, each having different licenses, which can

cause headaches for many organizations. For organizations, not knowing about the software installed can have a variety of consequences. For example, companies are not able to negotiate volume licensing options, unused licenses strain the organization's budget, license violations can lead to fines or public embarrassment, or companies increase their exposure to risks from malicious software (malware) included in unlicensed software (see Chapter 10, 'Securing Information Systems'). Software asset management helps organizations to avoid such negative consequences. Usually, software asset management consists of a set of activities, such as performing a software inventory (either manually or using automated tools), matching the installed software with the licenses, reviewing software-related policies and procedures, and creating a software asset management plan. The results of these processes help organizations to better manage their software infrastructure by being able to consolidate and standardize their software titles, decide to retire unused software, or decide when to upgrade or replace software; based on a recent survey, by increasing software compliance by 20 percent, companies can increase their bottom line by 11 percent.

EXTERNAL ACQUISITION THROUGH THE CLOUD. Undoubtedly, managing the software infrastructure is a complex task, often resulting in high operating costs for organizations; further, many systems are not scalable in response to large fluctuations in demand. To deal with these issues, business organizations increasingly use software as a service (SaaS)-that is, clients access applications in the cloud on an as-needed basis using standard web-enabled interfaces (see Chapter 3, 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services'). For organizations, using SaaS provides a variety of benefits, such as a reduced need to maintain or upgrade software, variable costs based on the actual use of the services (rather than fixed IS costs), and the ability to rely on a provider that has gained considerable expertise because of a large number of clients.

## Outsourcing Systems Development

Outsourcing systems development is a way to acquire new systems that closely resembles the process of in-house development. However, in the case of outsourcing, the responsibility for some or all of an organization's information systems development (and potentially the day-to-day management of its operation) is turned over to an outside firm such as Infosys or Accenture. Information systems outsourcing includes a variety of working relationships. The outside firm, or service provider, may develop your information systems applications and house them within their organization, it may run your applications on its computers, or it may develop systems to run on existing computers within your organization. Anything is fair game in an outsourcing arrangement. Today, outsourcing has become a big business and is a very popular option for many organizations (see Chapter 1 for more information on outsourcing).

WHY OUTSOURCING? A firm might outsource some (or all) of its information systems services for varied reasons. Typical reasons for outsourcing include (Applegate, Austin, &amp; Soule, 2009):

- ■ Cost and Quality Concerns. In many cases it is possible to achieve higher-quality systems at a lower price through economies of scale, better management of hardware, lower labor costs, and better software licenses on the part of a service provider.
- ■ Problems in IS Performance. IS departments may have problems meeting acceptable service standards because of cost overruns, delayed systems, underutilized systems, or poorly performing systems. In such cases, organizational management may attempt to increase reliability through outsourcing.
- ■ Supplier Pressures. Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the largest service providers are also the largest suppliers of software or computer equipment (e.g., IBM or HP). In some cases, the aggressive sales forces of these suppliers can convince senior managers at other organizations to outsource their IS functions.
- ■ Simplifying, Downsizing, and Reengineering. Organizations under competitive pressure often attempt to focus on only their 'core competencies.' In many cases, organizations simply decide that running information systems is not one of their core competencies and decide to outsource this function to companies such as Infosys, Accenture, or IBM, whose primary competency is developing and maintaining information systems.
- ■ Financial Factors. When firms turn over their information systems to a service provider, they can sometimes strengthen their balance sheets by liquidating their IT assets. Also, if

users perceive that they are actually paying for their IT services rather than simply having them provided by an in-house staff, they may use those services more wisely and perceive them to be of greater value.

- ■ Organizational Culture. Political or organizational problems are often difficult for an IS group to overcome. However, an external service provider often brings enough clout, devoid of any organizational or functional ties, to streamline IS operations as needed.
- ■ Internal Irritants. Tensions between end users and the IS staff are sometimes difficult to eliminate. At times, this tension can intrude on the daily operations of the organization, and the idea of a remote, external, relatively neutral IS group can be appealing. Whether the tensions between users and the IS staff (or service provider) are really eliminated is open to question; however, simply having the IS group external to the organization can remove a lingering thorn in management's side.

MANAGING THE IS OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIP. The ongoing management of an outsourcing alliance is the single most important aspect of the outsourcing project's success. Some advice includes the following:

1. A strong, active chief information officer (CIO) and staff should continually manage the legal and professional relationship with the outsourcing firm.
2. Clear, realistic performance measurements of the systems and of the outsourcing arrangement, such as tangible and intangible costs and benefits, should be developed.
3. The interface between the customer and the outsourcer should have multiple levels (e.g., links to deal with policy and relationship issues and links to deal with operational and tactical issues).

Managing outsourcing alliances in this way has important implications for the success of the relationship. For example, in addition to making sure a firm has a strong CIO and staff, it is recommended that firms assign full-time relationship managers and coordinating groups lower in the organization to 'manage' the project. The structure and nature of the internal system activities change from exclusively building and managing systems to also including managing relationships with outside firms that build and manage systems under legal contract.

USING OUTSOURCING STRATEGICALLY. Outsourcing can have many benefits to an organization, but it is important to know what and when outsource. Apple, for example, designs its new products internally but outsources product manufacturing. To Apple, quality and innovative design are central to its strategy-this strategic task cannot be outsourced! However, once the product is designed successfully, getting it reliably constructed is critical but not central to Apple's strategy. Apple simply needs a reliable partner to execute the manufacturing process. This suggests two key questions:

1. What to outsource?
2. When to outsource?

To provide a product or service, a company must perform many different types of tasks. Understanding the difference between strategic, critical, and routine tasks is important when considering what to outsource. For example, imagine if you just launched an energy drink company. This energy drink is quite expensive, utilizing a proprietary formula and the finest ingredients. Given the importance of quality control, manufacturing of your drink is not likely the best candidate for outsourcing. However, how the product gets shipped to stores is critical but not strategic. So, a reliable outsourcing partner like UPS might be attractive. Likewise, many routine tasks, such as the printing of a new product flier or even janitorial services in your offices, can be easily outsourced without putting the company in jeopardy. Such nonstrategic tasks are strong candidates for outsourcing.

It is almost always a good time to consider outsourcing nonstrategic tasks. However, some tasks will change in importance over time, creating a cost versus time trade-off to consider. For example, for your new energy drink company, you need an attractive and informative website so that customers can read all about your product and company. Nevertheless, at this time, you are distributing your product exclusively through retail outlets and are not utilizing the web and social media as a key aspect of your marketing and distribution strategy. However, you believe that sometime in the future, you plan to pursue an aggressive online marketing and social media strategy.

So, you could justify hiring an internal web development team today (because you will need them someday) or push this decision into the future, utilizing a local web developer to create your initial online identity. Hiring an internal team will be more expensive; outsourcing the development will be faster. Down the road, when you shift your strategy, you will likely be better off having your own development and social media marketing team. So, at one point in time, it may make sense to use outsourcing; however, at some other time, the situation may change and outsourcing may no longer be the best approach. Just as in your new energy drink company, many organizations are identifying strategic ways to utilize outsourcing.

It is likely that you will have numerous opportunities to participate in the acquisition or development of a new system for an organization for which you currently work or will work in the future. Now that you understand the process, you should be better equipped to make a positive contribution to the success of any systems development project.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Traditional Media and Advertising

Only a few years ago, radio and television were among the primary sources for satisfying the desire for both entertainment and up-to-date news and information. Over the past few years, this situation has changed dramatically, with many people turning to the internet for both entertainment and information.

of listeners to traditional radio has dwindled and, along with it, advertising revenues. facing competition from streaming music, satellite radio, podcasting, and a plethora of other online diversions, many radio stations will have to find innovative ways to prosper in these times of profound change.

for many television news companies, the internet has opened opportunities, as news features can be easily transmitted over the internet, allowing easier connection between the newsrooms and the 'action' in the field. At the same time, viewing habits have changed, and many viewers prefer to obtain their latest news via the internet or while on the move. As a reaction, television stations (both focusing on news and entertainment) are increasingly using the internet as a distribution medium for their content.

These changes force Tv stations to adjust their revenue models. Whereas traditionally large revenues were derived from advertising, advertisers are now less willing to pay high advertising fees in light of dwindling viewership, cordcutting, and decreasing viewer tolerance for interruptions. On the other hand, Tv stations can potentially charge more for advertising tied to online shows, as the internet offers benefits such as advertising targeted at the individual viewer and provides detailed tracking metrics such as click-through rates, allowing the advertiser to directly assess the success of a campaign.

for radio, the situation is similar. With more and more people listening to streaming music like Pandora or Spotify, or listening to satellite radio in their cars, the number

## Key Points Review

1. Describe how to formulate and present the business case for technology investments. Making the business case is the process of building and presenting the set of arguments that show that an information system investment is adding value to an organization. To make a convincing presentation, you should be specific about the benefits this investment will provide for the organization. Choosing the wrong measures can yield a negative decision about a beneficial system.
2. Describe the systems development life cycle and its various phases, as well as agile development methodologies. The development of information systems follows a process called the systems development life cycle. The SDLC is a process that first identifies the need for a system and then defines the processes for designing, developing, and maintaining an information system. The process is very structured and formal and requires the active involvement of managers and users. The SDLC has four phases: systems planning and selection, systems analysis, systems design, and systems implementation and operation. After the implementation, a system moves into an ongoing maintenance phase. A variety of

other approaches are available to enhance the development process for different types of systems and contexts. In particular, agile approaches are increasingly used in situations where requirements are uncertain or can change quickly. As agile methodologies focus on delivering quality products quickly and enable companies to obtain rapid feedback, they are well suited for developing minimum viable products and customer-facing systems.

3. Explain how organizations acquire systems via external acquisition and outsourcing. External acquisition is the process of purchasing an existing information system from an external organization or vendor. External acquisition is a five-step process. Steps 1 and 2 mirror the first two steps of the SDLC. Step 3 is the development of a request for proposal (RFP). Step 4 is proposal evaluation, which focuses on evaluating proposals received from vendors. Step 5 is vendor selection, which focuses on choosing the vendor to provide the system.

## Spreadsheet Application: Outsourcing Information Systems at Campus Travel

9-  34.

Campus Travel wants to increase its customer focus and wants to be able to better serve its most valued customers. Many members of the frequent-flier program have requested the ability to check on the status of their membership online; furthermore, the frequent fliers would welcome the opportunity to book reward flights online. As you know that there are several companies specializing in building such transactional systems, you have decided to outsource the development of such a system. The following weights are assigned to evaluate the different vendors' systems:

- ■ Online booking capability: 20 percent
- ■ User friendliness: 25 percent
- ■ Maximum number of concurrent users: 20 percent
- ■ Integration with current systems: 10 percent
- ■ Vendor support: 10 percent
- ■ Price: 15 percent

To evaluate the different offers, you need to calculate a weighted score for each vendor using the data provided in the Outsourcing.csv spreadsheet. To calculate the total points for each vendor, do the following:

- ■ Open the file Outsourcing.csv.
- ■ Use the SUMPRODUCT formula to multiply each vendor's scores with the respective weights and add the weighted scores.
- ■ Use conditional formatting to highlight all vendors falling below a total of 60 percent and above a total of 85 percent to facilitate the vendor selection.

## Database Application: Building a Special Needs Database for Campus Travel

9-  35.

In addition to international travel, travel reservations for people with special needs is an area of specialty of Campus Travel. However, to be able to recommend travel destinations and travel activities, you should know what facilities are available at each destination. Therefore, you have been asked to create a database of the destinations and the type of facilities that are available for people with special needs. To make the system as useful as possible for all, you need to design reports for the users to retrieve information about each destination. Your manager would like to have a system that contains the following information about the destinations:

- ■ Location
- ■ Availability of facilities for the physically handicapped
- ■ Distance to medical facilities
- ■ Pet friendliness

Each location may have one or more handicap facility (e.g., hearing, walking, sight, and so on). A type of handicap facility can be present at multiple locations. Also, each location must have one pet-friendly accommodation/activity and may also have accommodation for different types of pets (dogs, cats, and so on). After designing the database, please design three professionally formatted reports that (1) list the locations in alphabetical order, (2) list all locations that have the handicap facilities for those that find it difficult to walk, and (3) list all locations that have a cat-friendly policy.

Hint: In Microsoft Access, you can create queries before preparing the reports. Enter a few sample data sets to populate the reports.

developed in-house or outsourced to software development companies and this process involved numerous steps to design,  develop,  and  implement  systems.  Recent  years  have witnessed the emergence of cloud computing, an on-demand access  to  computing  resources  including  software  and  hardware  without  direct  operational  management  by  the  user.

Through  cloud  computing,  technology  resources  can  be offered as a 'service' instead of as a product, thereby advocating  for  access  rather  than  ownership.  This  means  that organizations can subscribe to and access computing resources as and when they are needed.

There are three main types of cloud services, namely software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). These services can be deployed via four main service models: public, private, community, and hybrid models. Examples of cloud computing services include Salesforce's on-demand customer relationship management systems and Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing infrastructure that provides a host of tools, technologies, and support services.

The main benefits of cloud computing are cost   savings, f lexibility,  low  setup  cost,  and  quick  implementation. However, there are some drawbacks such as vendor lockin,   security and privacy issues, and lack of control. In spite of these limitations, cloud computing continues to grow with the global cloud computing market projected to reach $791.48 billion by 2028.

## CASE 1 Next Generation Identification

As crime-solving aids, first there was fingerprinting; decades later came DNA analysis.  Next  is  the  US$1.2  billion  Next Generation Identification (NGI) database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), used to store biometric identification data ranging from palm prints to iris patterns, photos of scars and tattoos, and distinctive facial characteristics for criminal identification. In the past, fingerprints have been the most widely used means of uniquely identifying people, with the FBI keeping more than 100 million sets of fingerprints in its current database dubbed the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). The NGI system is more flexible and modular and can store additional biometric characteristics. Unfortunately, taken  alone,  many  of  those  have  been proven to be rather unreliable (facial recognition accuracy in public places can be as low as 10 to 20 percent, depending on lighting conditions), such that a real increase in identification accuracy can come only from combining  the  results  of  multiple biometrics.

Similar to the FBI's IAFIS database, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains the massive Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) database. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE), part of the

DHS, uses this database in its Secure Communities program to aid in capturing criminal  aliens.  Secure  Communities  is  a federal, state, and local government partnership that allows state and local law enforcement officials to quickly share data with ICE on captured suspects. The data forwarded to ICE are used to make immigration processing and removing more efficient if the suspect turns out to be a criminal alien. At the heart of Secure Communities is the automatic integration of the IAFIS and IDENT databases. When someone is arrested, local law enforcement puts the suspect's fingerprints into the FBI's database. However, the fingerprints are checked not only against the FBI's IAFIS system but also against the DHS's IDENT database to see if the suspect is in the country legally. If the suspect isn't legal, ICE can immediately begin the deportation process.  The  system  also  prioritizes removal of criminal aliens based on their risk to national security and the local community. The prioritization helps ensure that serious criminals (aliens or otherwise) are not inadvertently released and cuts down on the time criminal aliens must be held in custody before being returned to their home country. The FBI's NGI database will take this a step further, as it will not  only  be  based  on  data  from  both

existing databases but will also include a host of other biometric identifiers.

Both the FBI and Secure Communities programs have been criticized by privacy advocates. Critics say that Secure Communities, for example, can lead to unnecessary or prolonged detention, make accessing a lawyer difficult, and prevent release on bail. There is also a fear that there is no complaint mechanism associated with the systems. Opponents believe that victims of system errors will have little redress if they are erroneously identified as a criminal or illegal alien. In addition, opponents to the Secure Communities program argue that the integration of databases undermines the trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement agencies.

The FBI continues to develop their surveillance programs, and as of July 2020, a previously unannounced Multimedia Exploitation Unit (MXU) was revealed that leverages bulk data such as video to generate leads. The full capabilities of the MXU are not currently known, but it appears to build upon the capabilities of the NGI and IAFIS systems. While the FBI and ICE maintain that their programs are strictly limited to criminals and those in the country illegally, privacy and civil rights activists are watching the developments to ensure that the government respects the rights of its citizens.

## CASE 2 Big Data and the Elephant

It may seem obvious that the amount of data in the world keeps getting larger and larger, but what is really meant by Big Data ? Physical size of the storage device? Number of records? How do we effectively store it, and how do we approach doing useful things with it?

Big Data can be defined using three attributes: volume, velocity, and variety (often, the term veracity is added to refer to the often unknown origins of the data). Volume refers to traditional measures of size-how many bytes. A byte is an encoding of information using 8 bits-on or off states, like 1s and 0s. Large numbers of bytes are quantified using the same prefixes as metric units. Kilomeans 'a thousand,' mega'a million,' giga'a billion,' and so on. A single e-mail may be a few kilobytes of data including the message itself and the associated address information. A word processor document may be anywhere from a few kilobytes to a few megabytes depending on how long the contents are and if there are any embedded images. A high-definition movie takes up around 5 gigabytes when encoded and stored on a Blu-ray disc. An example of the high velocity of Big Data is the amount of video submitted to YouTubeevery minute more than 500 additional hours of video are uploaded. The variety aspect of Big Data represents all the different types of digital data we encounter-everything from e-mails, to homework assignments, to fitness tracker data, to photos, status updates, and VR videos. Veracity refers to the quality of the data and the ability to generate value from using accurate data. As the Internet of Things expands and more and more devices are connected all the time, the volume, velocity, and variety of data will only continue to increase, and ensuring veracity will be crucial to deriving value from Big Data.

So, how do we store and do something useful with this much data being generated so fast? Traditional mechanisms for storing and searching large data sets don't scale well. In the early 2000s, Google started utilizing a new approach that allowed for cheap hardware to be used to easily store and process large data sets. The key to the approach is to expect failure of any given component of the system and to design the system such that it can easily and rapidly recover when such failures do occur. The Google File System (GFS) spreads data across multiple servers and incorporates redundancy such that if any one server goes down, the others can pick up where it left off and no data get lost. To do something useful with this much data, however, requires even more  ingenuity.  Google  developed  an approach to split queries into multiple steps that can be distributed across multiple servers, much as the data files themselves get split up in GFS. First, the input data files are filtered and sorted into chunks (referred to as 'mapping'). Then, these chunks are distributed across multiple servers for processing. Each chunk gets processed into a smaller output set (the 'reduce' step). The algorithm is designed in such a way that these steps can be performed simultaneously on each chunk on different servers at the same time. Just like GFS, if  any  given  server  fails,  the  others  can smoothly recover and keep processing. These smaller output sets are then combined back together, and the process is repeated until a solution is reached. These steps lead to the algorithm's name: MapReduce .

known outside Google. As a result, many other  projects  implemented  a  similar approach. One of these projects, an open source effort, became very popular and widely used. The project was named Hadoop after a stuffed elephant belonging to the primary developer's son. Hadoop implements the core functions of GFS as the Hadoop Distributed  File  System  (HDFS)  and MapReduce  as  Hadoop  MapReduce. Because it is open source technology and can be freely incorporated into anyone's software system, it has been widely deployed. In keeping with the elephant name and logo, the suite of tools that grew up around Hadoop is called Mahout (a term for an elephant handler). Mahout and Hadoop were incorporated into the Apache Software Foundation suite of open source technologies.

MapReduce was a proprietary technology that belonged to Google and was a key part of its competitive advantage in the early 2000s. However, the underlying computer science research was published openly and

Google has moved past MapReduce as its primary Big Data processing model, and Mahout has also moved on to more capable processing models that are enabled by or improvements on Hadoop and MapReduce. Apache Pig is a high-level language for developing and implementing Hadoop programs. Hive is a data warehouse platform built on top of Hadoop and HDFS. New approaches to distributed processing beyond MapReduce that are being pursued by the Apache Foundation include Spark and Flink-both provide resilient distributed data set functionality and implement modern programming architectures using languages like Java and Scala. These technologies are a key part of the behind-thescenes infrastructure that makes our modern world work. Any platform, like an app store, a fitness app, or a social network, must deal with the challenges of volume, velocity, and variety. Technologies like Hadoop, Mahout, and their kin are what make it all possible.
