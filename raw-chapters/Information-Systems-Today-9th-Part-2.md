## Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems

## Preview

This chapter examines how organizations can use information systems (IS) strategically, enabling them to gain or  sustain  competitive  advantage  over  their  rivals.  As described  in  Chapter  1,  'Managing  in  the  Digital World,'  a  firm  has  competitive  advantage  over  rival firms  when  it  can  do  something  better,  faster,  more economically,  or  uniquely.  In  this  chapter,  we  begin by examining the role of information systems at different levels of the organization. We then examine how information  systems  support  various  business  models and introduce innovative business models enabled by information systems. Finally, we talk about the continual need to find innovative ways to succeed with and through information systems.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Startups and New Business Models

I n  addition  to  enabling  new  products  and  services, rapid advances in the capabilities of information technology enable entirely new business models. Some are refinements to existing approaches; others can be highly disruptive. Just because technology enables an innovative business model, however, does not mean that it can be easily or successfully implemented.

Examples  of  technology-enabled  business  models  include operating a platform, cutting out the middleman, selling  subscriptions,  and  providing  on-demand  services. Companies building a platform enable others-both other businesses and users-to co-create value. In this business model, companies like Airbnb use technology to facilitate information gathering, identify  willing  participants,  and simplify transactions. Cutting out the middleman (or disintermediation) means bypassing traditional retail channels and interacting directly with customers (Figure 2.1). Using this business model, eyeglass vendor Warby Parker and mattress seller Casper use technology to disrupt traditional  distribution  channels  and  directly  connect  with individual customers. Subscription-based services are facilitated by technology through the removal of friction from the transaction-the initial sign-up is greatly simplified through online forms, parameters of the subscription can easily be adjusted, and payment is made easy through digital transactions. All this adds up to a great opportunity

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Discuss how information systems can be used for automation, organizational learning, and strategic advantage.
2.  Describe how information systems support business models used by companies operating in the digital world.
3.  Explain why and how companies are continually looking for innovative ways to use information systems for competitive advantage.

to  gain  sustained  revenue  for  startups  and hassle-free experiences for customers. Netflix, Spotify, and Dollar Shave Club are examples of  businesses  that  have  been  very  successful  with  the  subscription  model.  Lastly,  ondemand services  have  grown  tremendously. Mobile and location-based technologies have allowed  substantial  new  opportunities  on both the supply and demand sides to enable on-demand  services.  The  most  widely  cited example is the car-hailing service Uber, with countless others who are trying to replicate Uber's success.

Technology enables new business models, such as cutting out the middleman and bypassing traditional retail channels to interact directly with customers.

A technology-enabled business model is not a guarantee  of  success.  Many  businesses  trying  to  replicate Uber's success in the on-demand arena have struggled, as not all goods and services are well suited to this approach.  There  are  certain  aspects  of  transportation and other services that make them well suited for ondemand delivery. In contrast, markets where there are high  and  varied  standards  for  customer  satisfaction such as house cleaning and dining, with an abundance of ready substitutes such as local cleaners and restaurants,  may  face  particular  challenges.  However,  with the rise in innovative business models, it might be only a  matter of time until a startup will come up with a suitable business model.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

1. What is the role of information systems and strategy in identifying a business model?
2. How have information systems enabled new, interesting business models like that of Uber, Spotify, and Airbnb?
3. How can organizations identify innovative technologies that form the basis for innovative business models?

Organizations are composed of different decision-making levels.

## Enabling Organizational Strategy Through Information Systems

In Chapter 1, we introduced the notion that for many organizations, information systems have strategic value. In addition, a broad range of information is needed to support an   organization's business processes. Business processes are the activities organizations perform to reach their business goals, including core activities that transform inputs and produce outputs, and supporting activities that enable the core activities to take place. As a review, we briefly describe how organizations are generally structured as well as the common functional areas of most modern organizations. Understanding how organizations are structured helps to illustrate how different types of information systems can support various business processes and provide different levels of value to the organization.

## Organizational Decision-Making Levels

Every organization is composed of different decision-making levels, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Each level of an organization has different responsibilities and, therefore, different informational needs.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL. At the operational level of a firm, the routine, day-to-day business processes and interactions with customers occur. Information systems at this level are designed to automate repetitive activities, such as processing sales transactions, and to improve the efficiency of business processes at the customer interface. A transaction refers to anything that occurs as part of a firm's daily business of which it must keep a record. Operational planning typically has a time frame of a few hours or days, and the managers at the operational level, such as foremen or supervisors, make day-to-day decisions that are highly structured and recurring. Structured decisions are those in which the procedures to follow for a given situation can be specified in advance. Because structured decisions are relatively straightforward, they can be programmed directly into operational information systems so that they can be made with little or no human intervention. For example, an inventory management system for a shoe store in the mall could keep track of inventory and issue an order for additional inventory when levels drop below a specified level. Operational managers within the store would simply need to confirm with the inventory management system that the order for additional shoes was needed. At the operational level, information systems are typically used to increase efficiency (i.e., the extent to which goals are accomplished faster, at lower cost, or with relatively little time and effort) by optimizing processes and better understanding the underlying causes of any performance problems. Using information systems to optimize processes at the operational level can offer quick returns on the IS investment, as activities at this level are clearly delineated and wellfocused. Figure 2.3 summarizes the general characteristics of the operational level.

MANAGERIAL/TACTICAL LEVEL. At the managerial level (or tactical level) of the organization, functional managers (e.g., marketing managers, finance managers, manufacturing managers, human resource managers) focus on monitoring and controlling operational-level activities and providing information to higher levels of the organization (Figure 2.4). Managers at this level, referred to as midlevel managers, focus on effectively utilizing and deploying organizational resources to increase effectiveness (i.e., the extent to which goals or tasks are accomplished well) to achieve the strategic objectives of the organization. Midlevel managers typically focus on problems within a specific business function, such as marketing or finance. Here, the scope of the decision usually is contained within the business function, is moderately complex, and has a time horizon of a few days to a few months (also referred to as tactical planning). For example, a marketing manager at Nike may decide how to allocate the advertising budget for the next business quarter or some other fixed time period.

Managerial-level decision making is not nearly as structured or routine as operational-level decision making. Managerial-level decision making is referred to as semistructured decision making because solutions and problems are not clear-cut and often require judgment and expertise. For semistructured decisions , some procedures to follow for a given situation can be specified in advance, but not to the extent where a specific recommendation can be made. For example, a business intelligence system could provide a production manager at Nike with performance analytics and forecasts about sales for multiple product lines, inventory levels, and overall production capacity. The metrics deemed most critical to assessing progress toward a certain goal (referred to as key performance indicators [KPIs] ) are displayed on digital

dashboards (see Chapter 6, 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence'). The manager could use this information to create multiple hypothetical production schedules. With these schedules, the manager could then perform predictive analyses to examine inventory levels and potential sales profitability, depending on the order in which manufacturing resources were used to produce each type of product.

EXECUTIVE/STRATEGIC LEVEL. At the executive level (or strategic level) of the organization, managers focus on long-term strategic questions facing the organization, such as which products to produce, which countries to compete in, and what organizational strategy to follow (Figure 2.5). Managers at this level include the president and chief executive officer, chief information officer, vice presidents, and possibly the board of directors; they are referred to as 'executives.' Executive-level decisions deal with complex problems with broad and long-term ramifications for the organization. Executive-level decisions are referred to as unstructured decisions because the problems are relatively complex and nonroutine. In addition, executives must consider the ramifications of their decisions in terms of the overall organization. For unstructured decisions , few or no procedures to follow for a given situation can be specified in advance. For example, top managers may decide to develop a new product or discontinue an existing one. Such a decision may have vast, longterm effects on the organization's levels of employment and profitability. To assist executivelevel decision making, information systems are used to obtain aggregate summaries of trends and projections of the future. At the executive level, information systems provide KPIs that are focused on balancing performance across the organization, such that, for example, product launches are staggered to smooth out the effects of spikes in demand on the supply chain. Other KPIs are used to benchmark the organization's performance against its competitors. Likewise, information systems used for executive-level decisions need to consider various types of unstructured data, such as data related to global economic factors, demographic changes, or changing customer tastes and preferences. Executives also engage in environmental scanning to assess how new information systems can help the organization offer new product or services and support strategy.

In summary, most organizations have three general decision-making levels: operational, managerial, and executive. Each level has unique activities and business processes, each requiring different types of information. In other words, it is common that each decision-making level is supported by different types of information systems.

## Organizational Functional Areas

In  addition  to  different  decision-making  levels  within  an  organization,  there  are  also  different functional areas. A functional area represents a discrete area of an organization that focuses on a specific set of activities. For example, people in the marketing function focus on the activities that promote the organization and its products in a way that attracts and retains customers; people in the accounting and finance functions focus on managing and controlling capital assets and financial resources of the organization. Table 2.1 lists various organizational  functions  and  lists  examples  of  the  types  of  information  systems  that  are

commonly used. These functional area information systems are designed to support the unique business processes of specific functional areas (Figure 2.6).

When deploying information systems across organizational levels and functions, there are three general ways the information system can provide value: to enable automating activities, to enable learning, and to enable the execution of organizational strategy (Figure 2.7). These three ways are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but we believe that each is progressively more useful to the firm and thus adds more value to the business. This is examined next.

## Information Systems for Automating: Doing Things Faster

Someone with an automating perspective thinks of technology to help complete a task within an organization faster, more cheaply, and perhaps with greater accuracy and/or consistency (in other words, increase efficiency). Let us look at a typical example. A person with an automating

mentality would take a loan application screening process and automate it by inputting the loan applications into a computer database so that those involved in decision making for the loans could process the applications faster, more easily, and with fewer errors. Such a system might also enable customers to complete the loan application online. A transition from a manual to an automated loan application process might enable the organization to deploy employees more efficiently, leading to even more cost savings (Table 2.2). With increasing digital density, there is the potential of using information systems to increase efficiency in almost every sector; for example, using various sensors to monitor machinery or product flows throughout production can tremendously improve the performance of companies in the manufacturing sector. Information systems at the operational level of an organization often help in automating repetitive activities, but they can also help to gather valuable data for higher decision-making levels within the organization.

Note: Many online loan application services can now give you instant 'tentative' approval pending verification of data you report in your online application. Also, only some of the activities within the manual and technology-supported processes can occur in parallel.

## Information Systems for Organizational Learning: Doing Things Better

We can also use information systems to learn and improve. By analyzing data created when automating  a  process,  improved  understanding  about  the  underlying  work  processes  can  be developed. The learning mentality builds on the automating mentality because it recognizes that information systems can be used as a vehicle for organizational learning -the ability of an organization to use past behavior and data to improve its business processes-and for change as well as for automation.

To illustrate a learning mentality, let us think again about our loan processing example. Figure 2.8 shows how a computer-based loan processing system can track types of loan applications by date, month, or season. The manager can easily see the trends and plan for the timely staffing and training of personnel in the loan department. The manager can also more efficiently manage the funds used to fulfill loans. This computer-based loan processing system, focusing on learning, is an example of an information system used at the managerial level of an organization.

A learning approach allows managers to track and learn about the types of applications filed by certain types of people at certain times of the year (e.g., more auto loan applications in the fall, mostly from men in their 20s and 30s), the patterns of the loan decisions made, or the subsequent performance of those loans. This new system creates data about the underlying business process that can be used to better monitor, control, and change that process. In other words, you learn from this information system about loan applications and approvals; as a result, you can do a better job at evaluating loan applications (i.e., increase effectiveness).

A combined automating and learning approach, in the long run, is more effective than an automating approach alone. If the underlying business process supported by technology is inherently flawed, a learning use of the technology might help you detect problems with the process and change it. For instance, in our loan processing example, a learning use of technology may help us uncover a pattern among the accepted loans that enables us to distinguish between low-and high-performing loans over their lives and subsequently to change the criteria for loan acceptance.

If, however, the underlying business process is bad and you are using technology only for automating (i.e., you would not uncover the data that would tell you this process is bad), you are more likely to continue with a flawed or less-than-optimal business process. In fact, such an automating use of technology may mask the process problems.

With a bad underlying set of loan acceptance criteria (e.g., rules that would allow you to approve a loan for someone who had a high level of debt as long as he or she had not been late on any payments recently), a person might manually review four applications in a day and, because of the problematic criteria used, inadvertently accept on average two 'bad' applications per week. If you automated the same faulty process, with no learning aspects built in, the system might help a person review 12 applications per day, resulting in up to six 'bad' applications accepted per week on average. The technology would serve only to magnify the existing business problems (Figure 2.9). Without learning, it is more difficult to uncover bad business processes underlying the information system.

Increasing digital density, along with the ability to learn from the data gathered through various interactions, can help to increase personalization, anticipation, and coordination.

## FIGURE 2.10

How increasing digital density enables Uber's business model.

<!-- image -->

For example, Uber uses a rider's past behavior to learn about her preferences and provide personalized ride recommendations. Likewise, Uber's app uses data about riders' and drivers' locations and a host of other factors to anticipate surges in demand and change pricing accordingly. This data, in turn, is also used to coordinate riders and drivers to optimize the matching of supply and demand (Figure 2.10).

## Information Systems for Supporting Strategy: Doing Things Smarter

Using information systems to automate or improve processes has advantages, as described previously. In most cases, however, the best way to use an information system is to support the organization's strategy. To understand why, think about organizational strategy -a firm's plan to  accomplish its mission and goals as well as to gain or sustain competitive advantage over rivals-and how it relates to information systems. When senior managers-at the executive level of the organization-conduct strategic planning , they form a vision of where the organization needs to head, convert that vision into measurable objectives and performance targets, and craft a strategy to achieve the desired results. A person with a strategic mentality toward information systems goes beyond mere automating and learning and instead tries to find ways to use information systems to achieve the organization's chosen strategy, such as by innovating, streamlining operations, optimizing the supply chain, or better understanding customers. This person wants the benefits of automating and learning but also looks for some strategic, competitive advantage from the system. In fact, in today's business environment, if a proposed information system isn't going to clearly deliver some strategic value (i.e., help to improve the business so that it can compete better) while also helping people to work smarter and save money in the process, then it isn't likely to be funded. Returning to the example of Uber, the ability to use information systems for personalization, anticipation, and coordination is clearly at the heart of their organizational strategy and is fundamental to their business model and essential to the long-term survival of the  organization.  Rather  than  solely  improving  organizations'  efficiency,  information  systems now enable technology- and data-driven business model disruption; in other words, incumbents

see their ways of working challenged by technology startups who approach the business in fundamentally different ways, grabbing market share from the incumbents and ultimately making existing business models obsolete.

## Identifying Where to Compete: Analyzing Competitive Forces

Organizations struggle with identifying the best uses of their resources to execute their strategy. Whereas some companies have a competitive advantage by being the first to enter a market (i.e., having a first-mover advantage ), most organizations must compete within established industries. Given that every industry is different, organizations need to analyze the competitive forces within their industry to better understand where to focus their resources. One framework often used to  analyze  an  industry  is  Porter's  (1979)  notion  of  the  five  primary  competitive  forces: (1) the rivalry among competing sellers in your industry, (2) the threat of potential new entrants into your industry, (3) the bargaining power that customers have within your industry, (4) the bargaining power that suppliers have within your industry, and (5) the potential for substitute products or services from other industries (Figure 2.11). Table 2.3 provides examples of how the internet has influenced the various competitive forces in an industry. Porter's five-forces model of competition can help you determine which forces may be most important and which specific technologies could be used to address these forces. You can then use this knowledge as the basis for identifying particular investments.

## Identifying How to Compete: Choosing a Generic Strategy

To achieve superior returns, a company needs to position itself within the industry it operates in to be able to counter the effects of the five forces and gain a competitive advantage (Porter, 1985, 2001). In Figure 2.12, we show some common organizational strategies organizations use to position themselves within the industry. An organization might decide to pursue a lowcost leadership strategy , as does Walmart, by which it offers the best prices in its industry on its goods and/or services. Alternatively, an organization might decide to pursue a differentiation strategy , as do Porsche, Nordstrom, and IBM, by which it tries to provide better products or services than its competitors. A company might aim that differentiation broadly at many different types of consumers, or it might focus on a segment of consumers, as Apple did for many years with its focus on high-quality computers for home and educational markets. Still  other  organizations  might  pursue a middle-of-the-road strategy, following a best-cost provider strategy ,  offering products or services of reasonably good quality at competitive prices, as does Dell.

## Identifying How to Compete: Resources and Capabilities

Choosing the right position not only helps a company attract customers but also helps focus investments in resources such as information systems and technologies to help gain a competitive advantage. In other words, no matter what generic strategy an organization chooses to pursue, it must have resources and/or capabilities that are superior to those of its competitors in order to gain or sustain a competitive advantage. Resources reflect the organization's specific assets that are utilized to achieve cost or product differentiation from its competitors. Examples of  resources  might  include  proprietary  technology,  brand  equity,  or  a  loyal  and  established customer base. Capabilities reflect  the  organization's  ability  to  leverage  these  resources  in the marketplace. For example, design quality or efficient operations could be capabilities that help a firm effectively utilize its resources. Together, the resources and capabilities provide the organization with distinctive competencies -such as innovation, agility, quality, or low

cost-in the marketplace. These competencies help to pursue the organizational strategy (lowcost leadership, differentiation, etc.) and make the organization's product valuable to its customers relative to its competitors; superior value creation occurs when an organization can provide products at a lower cost or with superior (differentiated) benefits to the customer (Figure 2.13). This is how organizations gain a competitive advantage. For many organizations, information systems are at the heart of the different resources, capabilities, or distinctive competencies. Figure 2.14 provides examples of resources, capabilities, and distinctive competencies used by companies to sustain competitive advantage.

## Identifying How to Compete: Analyzing the Value Chain

Managers use value chain analysis to identify opportunities where information systems can be used to gain a competitive advantage (Porter, 1985, 2001; Shank &amp; Govindarajan, 1993). Think of an organization as a big input/output process. At one end, supplies are purchased and brought into the organization. The organization integrates those supplies to create products and services that it markets, sells, and then distributes to customers. The organization also provides customer service after the sale of these products and services. Throughout this process, opportunities arise for employees

## IoT, AI, and Environmental Sustainability

Since the beginning of commercial electricity production in the late 19 th century, electricity production, distribution, and consumption has seen many changes. Whereas early electricity was generated using steam engines, issues such as resource scarcity and global warming have given rise to a tremendous interest in renewable energy, ranging from water, wind, and photovoltaics to the use of geothermal energy. At the same time, humans have become increasingly aware of the need for environmental sustainability, trying to minimize the negative effects of e-waste, make agriculture more sustainable, protect species, and provide for cleaner air and water. For a business, focusing on environmental sustainability often requires large upfront investments, but can have numerous positive long-term effects for the company as well as society.

to devise how to operate or repair the system. Today, digital twins can be used to model the interactions between a piece of equipment and its environment; likewise, feeding IoT sensor data into a device's digital twin enables troubleshooting or performing maintenance of devices that are difficult or even impossible to access.

Just as increasing connections and data can enable new, value-added interactions for a business, increasing digital density can help push us forward toward a more sustainable future. For example, IoT sensors and AI technology can be used to monitor the condition of physical devices ranging from computers to jet engines and wind turbines; by predicting equipment failure and optimizing repair and replacement intervals, these technologies can help maximize the life span of equipment, increase efficiency, and reduce waste and unnecessary repairs. Digital twins -that is, digital representations of physical objects-are increasingly used to complement such remote monitoring of assets. The origins of digital twins date back to NASA's early space missions, where (physical) replicas of space modules (such as Apollo 13) were used

Not only can machines be monitored using IoT and AI, but also plants and other living matter, and farmers can use various sensors to monitor soil conditions and crop growth, helping to maximize crop yields and minimize the need for harmful pesticides. To protect species and ecosystems, scientists are using cameras and other sensors. By monitoring and analyzing animal movements, forest areas, or oceans, researchers can obtain a better understanding of environmental conditions and come up with new ways of protecting species and habitats. The remote sensing capabilities of IoT devices, paired with AI's capabilities of detecting patters in large amounts of data, offer many promises across a range of applications related to environmental sustainability.

This set of activities that add value throughout the organization is known as the value chain within an organization.

Whereas the value chain model was initially created to focus on manufacturing, it can also be applied to service industries (sometimes with different activities being performed). For example, in a hotel, inbound logistics activities may include the receiving of supplies as well as handling reservations, and operations would include the day-to-day activities of checking guests in or out, cleaning rooms, preparing breakfast, and so on. Outbound logistics activities might be performed by the hotel's catering or event service. Sales and marketing activities include promoting the hotel or attracting business meetings and conventions. Finally, customer service activities performed after the guest has left may include registering or resolving guest complaints. Other organizations may lack inbound and/or outbound logistics activities, and different activities may be classified differently. Whereas the primary activities may differ, the supporting activities are likely to resemble those of other organizations. In the end, however, you should note that the value chain should serve as a tool to identify and analyze the different activities performed.

Value chain analysis is the process of analyzing an organization's activities to determine where value is added to products and/or services and what costs are incurred for doing so. In value chain analysis, you first draw the value chain for your organization by fleshing out each of the activities, functions, and processes where value is or should be added and where performance can be improved. Next, you determine the costs-and the factors that drive costs or cause

them to fluctuate-within each of the areas in your value chain diagram. You then determine which activities need to be optimized to improve performance, cut costs, and ultimately gain or sustain competitive advantage.

## The Role of Information Systems in Value Chain Analysis

Because information systems can automate and optimize many activities along the value chain, the use of information systems has become one of the primary ways that organizations improve their value chains. In Figure 2.15, we show a sample value chain and some ways that information systems can improve productivity within it. For example, many organizations use the internet to connect businesses with one another electronically so that they can exchange orders, invoices, and receipts online in real time. Likewise, organizations use various social media such as blogs, Twitter, or Facebook to connect with their customers.

## The Technology/Strategy Fit

You might be asking, if any information system helps do things faster and better and helps save money, who cares whether it matches the company's strategy? Good question. If money grew on trees, you probably would build and use just about every information system you could imagine. Organizations could build or acquire many different valuable systems, but they are constrained by time and money to build or acquire only those that add the most value: those that help automate and learn as well as have strategic value. Likewise, in today's fast-moving world, speed is of the essence in gaining a competitive advantage, so organizations must choose wisely which information systems to deploy. The old way for managers to think about information systems was that they were a necessary service, a necessary evil, and a necessary, distasteful expense that was to be minimized. Managers cannot afford to think this way anymore. Successful managers now think of information systems as a competitive asset to be nurtured and invested in and think of them as an enabler of opportunities and mechanism for supporting or executing their business model. In other words, organizations are trying to maximize business/IT alignment , and in most cases, they do not want systems that do not match the strategy, even if they offer automating and learning benefits. Further, while spending on information systems is rising, most companies are willing to spend money on projects only when they can see clear, significant value. Often, however, organizations have no choice in making some types of investments that may or may not coincide with their overall strategy. Such investments are called a strategic necessity -something the organization must do to survive.

Given this focus on the value that the system will add, an organization probably does not want a system that helps differentiate its products based on high quality when the organizational strategy is to be the overall industry low-cost leader. In other words, if a firm were pursuing a strategy for low-cost leadership, investments to help drive costs down would be valued over those that didn't. Throughout this book, we introduce various technologies, infrastructures, and services that can help organizations pursue their competitive strategy.

## FIGURE 2.15

Information systems can improve an organization's value chain.

We should also caution that merely choosing and implementing new or innovative information systems is not sufficient to gain or sustain competitive advantage. In any significant IS implementation, there must be commensurate, significant organizational change. For example, an established organization using a lean startup approach (discussed below) to realize new opportunities will need to make changes to processes, organizational roles, and the overall organizational culture and mindset. This typically comes in the form of business process management and other similar methods of improving the functioning of the organization as opposed to merely dropping in an information system with no attempts at changing and improving the organization.   We will talk more in   Chapter   7  , 'Enhancing Business Processes Using Enterprise Information Systems,' about the role of business process management for transforming organizational business processes.   Further, an information system can be only as effective as the business model that it serves, and bad business models can't be overcome by good information systems. Next, we will discuss different business models in the digital world.

## Business Models in the Digital World

We have examined how organizations can leverage technology investments to accomplish things faster, smarter, and more strategically. We also examined how to focus technology investments toward activities that provide competitive advantage and improve the performance of the organization's value chain. Taken together, organizations need to align their technology investments with their business model. A business model is a summary of a business's strategic direction that outlines how the objectives will be achieved; a business model specifies the value proposition as well as how a company will create, deliver, and capture value (  Osterwalder &amp; Pigneur, 2010  ) and

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Digital Nomads

The widespread availability of the internet and the ever-increasing performance and capabilities of mobile technology have changed the way we work even while we're traveling. Email can be checked from the beach and documents edited from the airport. one side effect of these changes has been the opportunity to work in a location-independent way. If you can stay connected from wherever you are, why does it matter where you are when you work? This new approach has enabled the lifestyle of the 'digital nomads.' Digital nomads are people who live and work wherever they feel like, using the internet and mobile technologies to connect with their customers or employers.

Popular locations for digital nomads share a few important criteria. The location must be an appealing place to live. As low cost of living and good weather are key drivers for many, digital nomads often choose places like Thailand, Indonesia, and Morocco. Those who seek more urban activities have located in cities like Bangkok, while beaches and resort towns are a draw for those looking to escape urban life. Next is good network connectivity. For digital nomads to be able to function effectively, they need to be able to connect to the internet via Wi-Fi or cellular networks or otherwise in a reliable manner. Finally, community is important. The types of enterprises and business activities that are conducive to the digital nomad lifestyle often require collaboration. For example, entrepreneurial activities are more successful when you have access to likeminded individuals to share and develop ideas.

While the digital nomad lifestyle may seem like a dream come true, there are many challenges. For a digital nomad, it  can be hard to earn as much money as a traditional employee, even with the same skill set-nomads often are challenged to maintain the kinds of relationships with their customers and employers that lead to lucrative contracts and more interesting assignments. There can also be a degree of resentment when customers and employers see pictures of nomads working in a hammock on the beachwhether or not this affects the quality of their work.

To be a successful digital nomad, it is not enough to just live location-free through technology. The job you do must be conducive to the work style, and the skills you need will be different from those of a traditional employee. More emphasis is placed on building and retaining networks to keep the pipeline of opportunities full. However, with the right skill set, the right opportunities, and some careful planning, a digital nomad lifestyle may be right for you.

identifies its customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, and cost structure. In other words, a business model reflects the following:

1. What does a company do?
2. How does a company uniquely do it?
3. In what way (or ways) does the company get paid for doing it?
4. What are the key resources and activities needed?
5. What are the costs involved?

How a company answers these questions dictates how and where information systems investments can be utilized to execute a competitive strategy and sustain an advantage over competitors. There are several components of a proper business model (Table 2.4). Each component plays a critical role in shaping all aspects of the business, including such factors as the expenses, revenues, operating strategies, corporate structure, and sales and marketing procedures. Generally speaking, anything that has to do with the day-to-day functioning of the organization is part of its business model, and information systems can be utilized to support and execute many aspects of the business model.

## Revenue Models in the Digital World

Perhaps the most important ingredient for any organization is determining how to generate revenue. A revenue model describes how the firm will earn revenue, generate profits, and produce a superior return on invested capital (even nonprofit organizations need a revenue model). In addition to sales, transaction fees, and advertising-based business models common in the offline world, the internet has enabled or enhanced other revenue models, such as affiliate marketing (see Table 2.5). Many companies selling products or services (such as Amazon) use the web as an economic medium to reach a large customer base; large numbers of customers allow these

companies to turn over their inventory quickly, thus enabling the company to offer low prices while still making a profit. Other companies (such as Netflix) generate revenue using a subscription model where customers pay a monthly or annual fee for using the product or service. In addition, the freemium model has become a popular way of providing digital products or services in the digital world. This is discussed next.

FREEMIUM. According to basic economics within a competitive marketplace, the price of something is set by its marginal cost-the cost of producing an additional unit of output. In recent years, the prices of computer processing, storage, and bandwidth-the fundamental building blocks for providing digital products or services-have been in a free fall, and cloud computing has turned many of these costs into variable costs. As the marginal costs of providing digital products of services continues to decrease, organizations are able to use a freemium ('free' + 'premium') approach; using a freemium approach, an organization gives away limited versions of a product or service for free to build a large customer base and charges a premium for unrestricted versions (typically on a subscription basis). For example, the cloud storage provider Dropbox offers free accounts with limited storage capacity and allows users to subscribe to accounts with larger storage space. Depending on the product or service offered, the restrictions of free versions can include limitations of features, bandwidth, storage, or number of users, or the product or service can be restricted to a certain class of users, such as educational users (see Figure 2.16).

Internet startups and app developers alike benefit from the ability to scale up quickly under the freemium approach; further, companies benefit from the paying subscribers as well as the free users, many of whom are likely to refer the product or service to their friends. However, a company choosing to use a freemium model must carefully choose which features to offer for free. On the one hand, the free offerings have to be compelling enough to attract new users; on the other hand, if too many features are offered in the free versions, few people will be willing to pay for the more feature-rich versions. Often, a process of fine tuning and adjustments is needed to strike this balance; this is especially difficult if it involves reducing service levels of the free offering (as was the case when the popular calendar app Fantastical suddenly decided to move previously free features to their premium offering).

The freemium business model has become extremely popular with mobile apps and, in particular, games. Mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga or Honor of Kings are free to download but offer players the option to make in-app purchases , allowing them to purchase access to

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## The Pains of Uber in China

using a combination of social, mobile, and Big Data, the car hailing service uber has built a successful business in many locations around the world by disrupting the local transportation industry. Entrenched, protected taxi monopolies have a hard time reacting and competing. What happens when the local transportation industry is willing to be just as disruptive? Many locales have attempted to protect their existing taxi systems legislatively or through the courts; uber has been sued countless times. In China, a competitor has taken a different tact-'out-disrupt' uber.

Didi Kuaidi was formed by the merger of rival taxi-hailing services from Alibaba and Tencent-two of China's internet giants. The service competed directly with uber in the private car ride-sharing market but also went much further. Later renamed Didi Chuxing, the service let users select between a taxi, private car, shared car, shuttle van, or even bus. This gave Didi Chuxing enormous reach and market potential. In early 2020, it had more than 15 million daily active users, owning more than 90 percent of China's private car ride-sharing market.

While uber has been successful by following a strategy to disrupt traditional markets and power structures and to compete ruthlessly, it learned-as companies from Amazon to Google did before-that the regulatory environment in China often tends to favor local businesses. Facing an increasingly hostile regulatory environment, uber was unable to compete with the powerful state-backed rival, and in mid-2016 withdrew from the Chinese market, selling all its assets to its Chinese competitor in return for a minority stake in the company.

In addition to transportation services, Didi Chuxing is using their resources to leverage vast investments in intellectual property such as self-driving vehicles, matchmaking, artificial intelligence, and energy services in order to maintain their dominance locally, as well as increase their reach in international markets. However, with the onset of the 2019 novel coronavirus (CovID-19), Didi Chuxing has faced a near collapse in rider demand (approximately 5 million daily active users), and an associated loss in profitability.

extra features, content, or in-game currency. This allows the games to quickly build a huge user base in addition to generating continuous revenue streams. For example, in 2019, the free game Honor of Kings raked in more than US$1.4 billion on iOS alone, merely through in-app purchases. This, in turn, is beneficial for the players as well, as the game's developers depend on the revenue stream and are, therefore, incentivized to continuously update and upgrade the game experience.

## Platform-Based Business Models and the Sharing Economy

Traditionally,  many  business  models  functioned  like  pipes,  where  products  were  produced  and pushed to the customers (Choudary, 2013). Increasing digital density has enabled new business models built around the concept of a platform. Rather than providing a product or service, a digital platform coordinates others-both other businesses and users-to co-create value (see Table 2.6). Platforms create digital ecosystems where some users create value and other users consume. For example, users uploading content to Instagram or Pinterest are producers of value that is consumed by others. Likewise, Uber and Airbnb are successful platforms that do not offer services themselves but depend on users to offer and consume services. As a result, a platform creates a so-called twosided market, and its success is dependent on the network effect. In the context of marketplaces, we can distinguish between two major types of network effects. On the one hand, same-side network effects relate to the increase (or decrease) in value as additional users join on the same side of the network. For example, as more users switch to iOS, everyone benefits from wider compatibility of its Keynote presentation format; conversely, as more riders use Uber, the competition for available rides increases, leading to increasing fares. On the other hand, cross-side network effects relate to the change in value for a user if users join on the other side. For example, the app store becomes more useful for users as more apps are added; conversely, app developers are more likely to develop iOS apps as more users use iOS (see Figure 2.17). A platform only has value if users participate in the production or consumption; thus, any platform-based business model must be attractive to both producers and consumers, and platform-based businesses must carefully evaluate the various same-side and cross-side network effects. Whereas platforms tend to be attractive as they often have negligible (or zero) marginal costs, they carefully must think about how to monetize their services. For instance, Airbnb uses a transaction fee-based revenue model (charging both parties), whereas YouTube charges neither the producers nor the consumers but a third party (advertisers). Today, many pipe-based businesses include platform elements, such as reviews created by users. As we move further into the digital future, every business must consider to what extent its business model will include platform elements and how these will influence its business strategy.

Many of these platforms match providers and customers directly without the need for traditional middlemen, a concept referred to as disintermediation (see Chapter 4, 'Enabling Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce'). As increasingly, individuals are sharing not only content (such as opinions or media) but physical goods or services on dedicated

platforms, many believe that we are moving toward a sharing economy. A sharing economy (sometimes referred to as a collaborative economy ) has been defined as 'an economic system in which assets or services are shared between private individuals, either free or for a fee, typically by means of the Internet' (Oxford Dictionary, 2016). As ownership is shared, assets can often be used more effectively. For example, increasing population density makes individual car ownership increasingly infeasible but enables efficient car sharing. At the same time, shared ownership, facilitated by technological platforms, can help to utilize the car during (otherwise) idle times. In other words, it is not ownership that counts but being able to access the asset or resource. While initially, the concept of a sharing economy included social goals, such as waste reduction or increasing human interaction, this is now of lesser importance. Yet many companies within the sharing economy contribute to achieving greater social welfare. For example, research has shown that a vehicle used by a car-sharing platform such as car2go (a subsidiary of German automaker Daimler) can replace up to 13 privately owned vehicles, and for some, Uber replaces the need for owning a vehicle (see Figure 2.18). Likewise, platforms such as Craigslist or eBay encourage the selling of used goods, extending the usable life of many products. On the other hand, examples such as the Lyft scooters show that the boundaries between true sharing models and increasingly refined renting models are becoming blurred.

Platform-based business models and the sharing economy are touted as offering many promises. In addition to benefits such as reduced car ownership or the reuse of otherwisediscarded goods, often-cited benefits include increasingly flexible work arrangements or people's ability to earn extra income by renting out their apartments to strangers using Airbnb or working as drivers for Uber. These business models, however, are not without criticism. For example, whereas the business models used by Uber or Airbnb disrupt traditional business models, often promising greater choices for end customers, they do so at a cost for humans and society. In this ' gig economy ,' workers are not employed by the company, but are only hired for short-term, temporary jobs. In many cases, worker's rights-which people have fought for since the industrial revolution-are neglected, with workers having no protection against discrimination, no social security, little job security, and so on; likewise, income opportunities as well as social interactions with coworkers are often severely limited. Further, in their endeavor to disrupt traditional business models (such as hotels or limousine services), companies such as Uber and Airbnb try to gain a competitive advantage over traditional businesses by breaking (or at least bypassing) existing laws and regulations. While arguably, laws and regulations will (have to) adapt to new technologies in the short or long term, such behavior can often be regarded as unfair competition.

In the sharing economy, shared ownership reduces the need for individual ownership of cars and other goods.

## Service-Based Business Models

The ever-increasing digital density has enabled another type of business models, not centered on selling products but providing these as services (sometimes referred to as XaaS ,  or  'X as a service'). Many traditional manufacturers use pipe-based business models to produce goods which are then sold to the end users. Under a service-based business model, a manufacturer can offer equipment services, such as offering the product itself as a service or offering operations and optimization services, or information services, such as selling data or insights generated by the customer's usage of the product (see   Figure   2.  19  ). For example, manufacturers of jet engines, such as Rolls-Royce or GE, traditionally would sell engines to the owners of aircraft (such as airlines); however, as the bargaining power of buyers is high in the industry, the market for new engines is competitive, so much of the manufacturers' revenue typically comes from performing maintenance and selling spare parts. Under a service-based business model, in contrast, a manufacturer such as GE is being paid for guaranteeing continuous uptime, essentially providing 'thrust as a service.' The customer thus does not have to purchase the engine or spare parts but pays for hours of usage, transforming fixed costs into variable costs; the engine manufacturer only earns money for operating engines and thus has an incentive to improve the engine's design and perform preventive maintenance. Obviously, such business models are only possible through rapid advances in Internet of Things technology; using a multitude of sensors integrated throughout the engines and connected to the Internet, GE can continuously monitor and analyze engine performance and use advanced analytics to predict potential engine failure and better

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## The Ethics of the Sharing Economy

The sharing economy is taking off. Two standouts have been uber and Airbnb. uber is a service that connects people in need of rides with drivers willing to give one. As of early 2020, uber was available in more than 70 countries and 900 cities worldwide. Airbnb is a service that connects people looking for a place to stay with people who have a room or a house available to rent. As of early 2020, Airbnb had more than 7 million listings in 100,000 cities in 220 countries. As with any successful new business, many people are looking to duplicate successful business models and try to understand the secrets of success. Since both uber and Airbnb have thrived on disrupting existing markets that are heavily regulated (i.e., taxi services and hotels), the question that comes to many people's mind is: Are uber and Airbnb breaking any laws or regulations to drive their success?

further, as Airbnb hosts typically do not collect lodging (or occupancy) taxes from the guests, municipalities typically lose out on considerable tax revenues. Another criticism is the reduction of long-term housing associated with the unregulated renting of properties in residential neighborhoods.

Taxi services are heavily regulated. To provide for rider safety, drivers must undergo extensive screening and background checks, and vehicles are regularly inspected. In addition, to control markets and limit the number of taxis in the street, the economics of taxi systems are often regulated at the city level. A medallion (taxi permit) is required to provide taxi services, and there are a limited number of them available. To own a medallion, a driver (or taxi company) must comply with all regulations and pay an often-substantial fee. To drive for uber, no such fees or inspections are requiredthough the service has added background checks in certain jurisdictions. Some cities such as London have pressured uber to ensure their drivers are properly vetted, resulting in a failure to renew their license to operate in late 2019. Likewise, hotels and other forms of lodging are regulated as well. In addition to the properties themselves being regulated for safety and security, many jurisdictions are interested in maintaining consistency in their zoning laws and ensuring the proper collection of tax revenue. Those renting out their apartment or house via Airbnb are not affected (or ignore) such regulations;

Both uber and Airbnb would argue that they are simply removing transactional friction from markets for services that are already permissible under existing laws. others argue that uber and Airbnb are simply shifting costs to others involved in the value chain for these services, such as drivers and homeowners. The challenge remains that the existing laws and regulatory frameworks provide for and protect existing economic stakeholders and interests. Whether new sharing economy entities like uber and Airbnb are playing fair or not, these stakeholders will not take such challenges lying down. Expect more challenges and highly public disputes to come.

## Questions

1. Should services like uber and Airbnb follow the same rules and regulations as a taxi company or hotel? Why or why not? Explain.
2. Imagine creating a platform for individuals to connect and sell meals out of their home or apartment to paying customers using a method resembling uber. What concerns could this raise?

schedule maintenance events. Similarly, Philips provides lighting as a service for dozens of parking garages of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority; the transit authority needs no upfront capital for the lighting, and Philips installs and maintains the lighting and earns revenue through continuous energy-cost savings. These business models, however, require new thinking by the players involved. For instance, rather than focusing on minimizing manufacturing costs to increase profit margins, the manufacturers have to focus on life span and ease of maintenance/ repair. Likewise, to maximize revenues, the manufacturers must be able to monitor performance, predict outages, and schedule maintenance; all of this would not be possible without sensors connected to the Internet that provide continuous data streams and advanced Big Data analytics.

Making the transition from a product-oriented toward a service-based business model, however, is not without challenges. For example, whereas selling a product typically involves negotiating price and features, selling services involves not only developing new pricing models and implementing new business processes but also negotiating service level agreements with the customers (see Chapter 3, 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services').

Likewise, managing inventories and capacities is more challenging due to fluctuations in demand for services. Finally, the targeted customer segment for products is often different from that for services, which necessitates changes to marketing and communication with customers.

## Valuing Innovations

Innovation is key for organizations attempting to gain or sustain a competitive advantage, be it through cost or differentiation. Companies that are leaders in their respective markets or have strong brands often tend to find it difficult to react appropriately to new trends, and Cisco's former CEO John Chambers predicted that almost half of today's leading businesses might not see the next decade (EY, 2018). For organizations, innovation involves creating new products, processes, or services that return value to the organization (note that in contrast to merely inventing new products, services, or processes, innovation involves realizing the value). The most common form of innovation is incremental innovation, which involves enhancing or upgrading existing products,  services,  or  processes.  In  contrast, radical  innovations (sometimes  called disruptive innovations ) use a markedly new or different technology to access new customer segments and/or provide significantly greater benefits to existing customers and eventually marginalize or replace existing products or services (Chandy &amp; Tellis, 1998) (see Table 2.7). When hearing innovation , people often only think about innovative products or services. Innovative products

or services (even radical innovations), however, can easily be copied, and focusing only on these can be a dangerous path; in fact, many leading companies, ranging from Apple to Dyson, all too frequently engage in lawsuits to protect their innovations from copycats. Successful organizations thus go beyond product and service innovation and introduce other innovations such as new ways of earning revenue or entirely new business models. In their book Ten Types of Innovation , Keeley et al. (2013) outline how different types of innovations can help organizations gain or sustain competitive advantage (see Table 2.8).

Given that product performance innovations can often be easily copied, companies frequently combine multiple types of innovations to sustain competitive advantage. For example, Apple is typically known for its product innovations; yet, while the design and functionality of Apple's innovative products have been widely imitated, other companies find it difficult to copy Apple's product system innovations or customer engagement innovations. Likewise, computer manufacturer Dell combined profit model innovations (collecting money before building the product), process innovations (the built-to-order model), and channel innovations (selling computers online rather than in stores) as well as other types of innovation to challenge established computer manufacturers.

Most (if not all) of these innovations are enabled by or would not even be possible without information systems. For example, platform-based business models, such as used by Airbnb, would not be possible without the internet; likewise, Uber's business model could not exist

Some enabling technologies on the horizon.

without mobile devices used by riders and drivers, and Uber would not be able to implement its dynamic pricing feature (called 'surge pricing') without real-time analysis and prediction of traffic conditions and demand for services. For companies manufacturing physical products, process innovations enabled by robotics and the Industrial Internet of Things offer tremendous improvements in efficiency, product quality, agility, and flexibility, allowing companies to massproduce customized products (see Chapter 4). Thus, an organization often must deploy new, state-of-the-art technologies to gain or sustain a competitive advantage. Although firms can choose to continually upgrade older systems rather than investing in new systems, these improvements can often at best give only a short-lived competitive edge.

To gain and sustain significant competitive advantage, firms must often deploy the latest technologies or redeploy and reinvest in existing technologies in clever, new ways. For example, architects and interior designers use virtual reality (VR) headsets -head-mounted devices enabling immersive three-dimensional experiences-such as Oculus Rift to allow customers to virtually explore planned buildings or offices before construction has started; likewise, Marriott used the Oculus Rift headset to 'teleport' users to vacation destinations, and the tourism board of British Columbia produced 360-degree tours of the province. Virtual reality headsets are quickly becoming mainstream, with companies such as Insta360 and GoPro offering virtual reality cameras that allow capturing 360-degree videos that can be viewed using a virtual reality headset. Similar to virtual reality, augmented reality uses information systems to enhance a person's perception of reality by providing relevant information about the user's surroundings; typically, special glasses or other devices are used to augment the user's view of the real-world environment with computer-generated content. An early application of augmented reality was Google Glass, eyeglasses with a tiny embedded screen, which augmented reality by displaying information about the wearer's surroundings, including weather information, public transportation schedules, reviews about a restaurant the wearer is looking at, and other useful information. In its latest edition, Google Glass takes this concept a step further by enabling mixed reality, where the user's view of the real-world environment is augmented with 3D content, enabling applications ranging from providing remote assist capabilities for engineers to minimally invasive surgical procedures, similar to the applications enabled by Microsoft's HoloLens 2. No matter which of these products will eventually succeed in the marketplace, exciting new technologies are on the horizon.

But with the plethora of new information technologies and systems available, how can you possibly choose winners? Indeed, how can you even keep track of all the new breakthroughs, new products, new versions, and new ways of using technologies? For example, in Figure 2.20 we present a small subset of some new information technologies and systems, ranging from some that are here now and currently being used to some that are easily a decade away from being a reality. Which one is important for you? Which one will make or break your business? Does this list even include the ones that you need to be concerned about?

## The Need for Constant IS Innovation

Sir John Maddox, a physicist and the editor of the influential scientific journal Nature for 22 years, was quoted in Scientific American in 1999 as saying, 'The most important discoveries of the next 50 years are likely to be ones of which we cannot now even conceive.' Think about that for a moment. Most of the important discoveries of the next 50 years are likely to be things that, at present, we have no clue about. To illustrate that point, think back to the state of the internet back in 1999. Then, the internet was not on the radar screens of many business organizations. Those that had websites were mostly providing an electronic brochure to customers and weren't exploiting the technology to streamline business processes as is the norm today. Look now at how the internet has transformed modern business. How could something so transformational not have been easier for businesses to imagine or predict a decade earlier? It is difficult to see these things coming. Organizations that want to remain successful and relevant in the future need to transform into 'bimodal' organizations, where parts of the organization focus on exploiting existing capabilities and technologies (i.e., focus on 'earning'), whereas other parts of the organization focus on discovering and developing new and innovative interactions or service offerings enabled by increasing digital density (i.e., focus on 'learning'). Next, we examine how you can improve your ability to spot and exploit new innovations.

## Successful Innovation Is Difficult

As we hinted at previously, there are limits to using emerging information systems to innovate and gain or sustain a competitive advantage. Information systems are often bought from or built by someone else. If they are purchased from a vendor, the information systems are usually not proprietary technologies owned by the organization. For example, although a soft-drink company can patent the formula of a cola or a pharmaceutical company can patent a new drug, an organization typically cannot patent its use of an information system, particularly if it is purchased from an external vendor. The data in the system may be proprietary, but the information system typically is not. If, on the other hand, the systems are developed by a consultant or outsourcing partner, they are proprietary to the organization. Many of today's business models have information systems at their very core, so organizations are often forced to develop systems that enable such business models.

INNOVATION IS OFTEN FLEETING. Given the pace of change in the digital world, advantages gained by innovations often have a limited life span. For example, even in situations where an organization has developed an innovative information system in-house, it usually did so with hardware, software, and networking components that others can also purchase. In other words, rivals can copy innovative information systems, so this form of competitive advantage can be short-lived. Indeed, if use of the new system causes one organization to gain a significant advantage over others, smart rivals are quick to duplicate or improve on that use of the system. Likewise, rivals can copy innovative products, services, or processes. One classic counterexample, however, is Amazon's patented 'one-click' ordering process that has been successfully defended in the courts. Further, it is often difficult to copy the 'secret sauce' that is key to the functioning or success of a system.

INNOVATION IS OFTEN RISKY. Choosing among innovative IS-related investments or potential product, service, or process innovations always entails risk. The classic example from consumer electronics is the choice of a videocassette recorder (VCR) in the early days of that technology and the competing Betamax (developed by Sony) and VHS (developed by JVC) formats. Most experts agreed that the Betamax had superior recording and playback quality, but VHS ultimately won the battle in the marketplace. People who made the 'smart' choice at the time probably would have chosen a VCR with the Betamax format. Ultimately, however, that turned out to be an unfortunate choice. Recently, consumers again had to choose between two competing formats, namely, for high-definition (HD) DVD players, where the Blu-ray and HD DVD formats competed to become the industry standard. In this battle, Microsoft, Toshiba, and many others backed the HD DVD format, while Sony led the fight for Blu-ray (and even incorporated it into its PlayStation 3 gaming console). This time around, Sony (and the Blu-ray format) won the 'format war,' with the dissolution of the HD DVD Promotion Group in early 2008, effectively making Blu-ray the dominant format for HD video discs (Figure 2.21). Choosing among innovative IS-related investments is just as risky as choosing consumer electronics. In fact, for organizations, choosing among the plethora of available innovative technologies is far riskier, given the size and often mission-critical nature of the investment. Choosing a suboptimal DVD player, although disappointing, is usually not devastating.

INNOVATION CHOICES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT. Choosing new technologies in the IS area to develop innovative products, services, or processes is like trying to hit one of several equally attractive fastmoving targets. You can find examples of the difficulty of forecasting emerging technologies in the experiences that many organizations have had in forecasting the growth, use, and importance of the internet. The 1994 Technology Forecast, prepared by the major consulting firm Price Waterhouse (now PwC), mentioned the word internet on only five pages of the 750-page document. The next year, more than 75 pages addressed the internet. Only 3 years later, in the 1997 briefing, the internet was a pervasive topic throughout. Back in 1994, it would have been difficult, perhaps even foolish, to forecast such pervasive, rapidly growing business use of the internet today. Table 2.9 illustrates how many people and organizations have had difficulty making technology-related predictions.

Given the pace of research and development in the IS and components area and the increasing digital density, staying current has been nearly impossible. Probably one of the most famous metrics of computer evolution has been 'Moore's law.' Intel founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors that could be squeezed onto a silicon chip would double every 24 months (this number is now often reduced to 18 months), and this prediction has proven itself over the past 40 years (see Chapter 3). In fact, some computer hardware and software firms roll out new versions of their products every 3 months. Keeping up with this pace of change can be difficult for any organization.

## Open Innovation

Given the difficulties associated with innovation, organizations increasingly realize that potential for innovation often exists outside of their boundaries and try to harness the creativity of external stakeholders. Open innovation , or the process of integrating external stakeholders into the innovation process, can thus prove very beneficial. For example, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly created a site called InnoCentive, where companies can post scientific problems and everybody can take a shot at solving the problem. Usually, a reward is paid to a successful solver. This way, an ad hoc research-and-development network is created, and companies must rely less on a dedicated research-and-development department or on hiring specialists to solve a certain problem. At the same time, people can use their spare time and expertise to solve problems and earn rewards for their contributions. Other companies, such as P&amp;G (Connect + Develop), Starbucks (My Starbucks Idea), Lego (Lego Ideas), Heineken (Innovators Brewhouse), and Marriott (Travel Brilliantly), have successfully used open innovation to solicit ideas for novel products, services, or processes. Integrating external stakeholders into the innovation process, however, often involves making organizational data and knowledge accessible to the external stakeholders, so companies must carefully balance the benefits and potential drawbacks of engaging in such initiatives.

## The Innovation Process

As  you  can  see,  using  innovation  to  gain  and  sustain  competitive  advantage  is  difficult.  For example, if you are using information systems to gain a competitive advantage in the area of operating  efficiencies,  it  is  likely  that  your  rivals  can  just  as  easily  adopt  the  same  types  of

information systems and achieve the same gains. There are certainly ways to use information systems to create innovative products, services, or processes to gain a longer-lasting, sustainable competitive advantage; if you can use information systems to make your products or services unique or to cause your customers to invest so heavily in you that their switching costs are high (i.e., if switching to a competitor's product involves significant investment in terms of time and/ or money for the customer), then you are better able to develop a competitive advantage that is sustainable over the long haul. For example, the Israeli tech startup Waze developed a unique algorithm that incorporated map data, real-time traffic information, and crowdsourced data for routing and navigation; the app was so successful that Google ended up purchasing the app in 2013. Salesforce.com developed a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) system that allowed its users to store and manage the entire history of their interactions with each of their customers and to provide very high-quality, intimate, rapid, and customized service; for organizations using Salesforce.com, switching to a different CRM provider would be exceedingly difficult, and if they switched to a rival, it would take them years to build up that integrated view of their customer relationships.

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Augmented Shopping Experiences

Do I look good in these jeans? We have all asked our friends, family, or retail employees this very simple question. obviously, because there is a person standing next to you at the retailer, they must be an expert on the matter. or are they? Futurist Peter Diamandis sees another option that will allow us to receive a qualified answer to the very important jeans question-an artificially intelligent 'shopping' digital assistant.

Diamandis imagines a shopping experience where the digital assistant knows you and your preferences better than you do. The digital assistant has access to your shopping history, the shopping history of others that are like you, and data from other shopping sources as well. Artificial intelligence (AI) will therefore enable the assistant to give you the best answer and provide a recommendation that will actually fit your body and style. In the near future, the shopping assistant will likely leverage augmented reality (AR), where your AI assistant will superimpose images of products and fit on special glasses, visor, or mobile technology. Sure, you might look a little strange in the near term wearing an AR headset at your local shopping mall. However, you'll see models of jeans and how they fit you, right in front of your eyes, so you know you will be making the right decision.

environment presented by AR. That is, instead of augmenting a physical store with AR, vR technologies would completely separate the shopper from the real environment. However, vR technologies continue to advance and have even   been used by the fashion industry to showcase styles when in person gatherings were shut down by CovID-19. Fashion label Hanifa illustrated  the  use  of  3D  modeling  and  vR  to  deliver  a computer-generated fashion show. Described as both haunting and beautiful, the show was a hit and illustrated designer Anifa Mvuemba's skill without an audience and without human models. Instead, the designs were showcased by invisible avatars, bringing the design and execution of fashion to the forefront.

However, sustainable competitive advantage often results from being able to solve a customer's problem in a unique or superior way. Traditionally, companies would try to develop a product and find a market for it (sometimes referred to as inside-out thinking). In contrast, truly innovative companies are trying to understand the customer's problem and develop a unique solution to that problem (sometimes referred to as outside-in thinking). Rather than thinking about the means (i.e., the solutions), innovative companies focus on the ends, or the customer's 'job-to-be-done' and the various friction points that prevent the customer from accomplishing their goals.

In today's fast-changing world, incumbents do not compete only against a small number of traditional competitors but face ever-increasing competition from a large number of small, nimble startups. Thus, gaining a competitive advantage requires continuous innovation and the ability to flexibly experiment with different solutions or business models, and do so as quickly as possible. The lean startup methodology , pioneered by Eric Ries, provides a framework for such an approach. Traditionally, companies would develop a product and subsequently attempt to find customers for it. Under the lean startup approach, a company first searches for a viable product and business model, only executing the business model once they have found a fit between the product and the market (See   Figure   2.  22  ).

How would this approach work in practice? In the 'search' phase, you engage in customer discovery and customer validation. Customer discovery involves finding out whether the perceived problem actually exists and whether there would be a market for a hypothetical solution; once you have established this, the second step of customer discovery entails finding out whether your envisioned solution would actually address this problem. It is important

<!-- image -->

to note that this entails talking to potential customers-i.e., 'getting out of the building'before starting to build something. Once you have established that there is a potential market and your hypothetical solution would address the problem, you can start building a so-called minimum viable product (MVP) , which is a product containing just the features needed to demonstrate how your solution meets the problem. With this MVP, you are moving into the customer validation phase to test your hypothesis as to whether customers would be willing to pay for the solution. If at any stage of the search process, you discover that any of your hypotheses doesn't hold, it is time to pivot -changing your direction while being grounded in what you learned. As an example, Instagram started out as an app called Burbn, which combined a host of features, ranging from check-ins to gaming. Once the founders realized that this multitude of features was not valued by the users, they stripped down the app to the key features of sharing photos and commenting. After this pivot, Instagram quickly transformed into the tremendously successful app it is today. Typically, you would go through several iterations and pivots before finding the product/market fit. In the lean startup methodology, these iterations are known as the build-measure-learn cycle that enables validated learning (i.e., empirically testing assumptions or hypotheses through customer feedback to improve future iterations, see Figure 2.23): First, you build your MVP as quickly as possible (typically using agile development that aligns well with the lean startup approach-see Chapter 9, 'Developing and Acquiring Information Systems') and design an experiment that would allow you to test your hypothesis (e.g., that your solution addresses the customer's problem, or whether potential customers would be willing to pay for your solution). Next, you collect data ('measure'), such as responses to questionnaires, effectiveness of search engine marketing campaigns, and so on, to test your hypothesis. In the 'learn' phase, you decide whether to pivot or to persevere, and use this learning to try to find a different problem, think up a different solution, change/modify your MVP, or move into the execution phase, where you scale your business.

Just as the search phase consists of two steps, so does the execution phase. In particular, in the customer creation phase, you test the hypothesis of whether it is possible to establish a repeatable business model. The final step entails building the company and scaling operations and the organization. As you can see, throughout these processes, the focus is on experimentation and learning, before you find a product/service and a business that enables you to be successful in the market; further, it is of the essence to get out of the building, learn from actual

customers, and fail fast, so as to be able to quickly adjust your strategy while minimizing waste. Does the lean startup approach only work for startups? No. In fact, established companies ranging from Alaska Airlines to Philips and 3M have successfully employed lean startup processes to develop innovative products and services.

## Organizational Requirements for Innovation

Whereas  established  organizations  can  benefit  from  radical  approaches  to  innovation,  this sometimes requires fundamental changes to the organization. In particular, the organization's processes, resources, and risk tolerance must be capable of adapting to and sustaining the development and implementation processes.

PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. To  successfully  use  the  lean  startup  methodology,  an organization needs to change organizational processes and incentive systems. For example, innovation and, in particular, the development of an MVP using agile approaches require close collaboration of cross-functional teams-something that is usually uncommon in established organizations. Likewise, the organization must incentivize experimentation and innovation within the organization, with accountability and incentives on the team level, rather than on the individual level. Further, the iterative nature of the lean startup methodology necessitates a more startup-like budgeting model, where funds are approved as the project is moving through the stages, or can quickly be cut if the project does not bring the anticipated results.

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS. Organizations focusing on innovation must also have the people necessary to implement innovative systems or to develop innovative products, services, or processes. The organization must have enough employees available with the relevant knowledge, skills, time, and other resources to quickly build MVPs. Alternatively, the organization must have resources and able systems partners available to outsource the development of such systems, if necessary.

RISK TOLERANCE REQUIREMENTS. The last requirement is that its members must have the appropriate tolerance for risk and uncertainty as well as the willingness to test products that may not meet the customers' requirements and fail fast, if needed. If people within the organization desire low risk, then gambling on cutting-edge innovations using a lean startup approach will probably not be desirable or tolerable for them. Likewise, open innovation initiatives typically require sharing organizational knowledge with outside partners, and organizations trying to leverage outsiders in their innovation process must be willing to accept the potential risks involved.

THINKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN RADICAL INNOVATIONS. The preceding discussion on innovation suggests three new ways to think about innovations:

1. Put Technology Ahead of Strategy. With increasing digital density, technology is so important to strategy and to success that you have to begin with technology. Innovative companies do not begin with strategy, as a traditional approach to running a business organization would suggest. In fact, many would argue that given how important technology is today and how fast it changes, if you start with a strategy and then try to retrofit technology into your aging strategy, you are doomed. Innovative companies focus on their potential customers' jobs-to-be-done and use a lean startup approach to test whether the problem indeed exists and whether their envisioned solution addresses this problem, before developing a fully-fledged strategy. This approach is admittedly very uncomfortable for people who think in traditional ways and/or who are not comfortable with technology. We believe, however, that for many modern organizations, thinking about technology in this way is key.
2. Think in Terms of Problems before Designing Solutions. The second way that this approach turns conventional wisdom on its head is that organizations should drop insideout thinking in favor of outside-in thinking. A very traditional marketing-oriented approach would be to develop a solution and try to sell it to potential clients. The trouble with this approach is that your customers are likely to understand their problems very well, but are not experts in the solutions, and are not likely to know about new technologies and their capabilities. In some sense, they are the last place you ought to be looking for ideas about

new technologies and their impact on your business. Indeed, if they know about the new technology, then chances are your competitors already do too, meaning that this technology is not the one to rest your competitive advantage on. As Steve Jobs of Apple put it, 'You can't just ask people what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.'

3. Innovation Is Continuous. The third way that this approach is interesting-and potentially troubling-is that the process must be ongoing. Innovative companies are constantly on the lookout for the 'next new thing' that will revolutionize the business, and continue 'hout of the building' to test new hypotheses about problems, solutions, and business models. The rate of information technology evolution is not likely to slow down, and innovative organizations truly cannot-and do not-ever rest.

Today, dealing with rapid change caused by radical innovations is a reality for most industries. If you are a leader in an industry, you must continually learn to embrace and exploit radical innovations, potentially destroying your existing core business while at the same time building a new business around the radical innovation. If you fail to do this, your competition may do it for you.

## SECURITY MATTERS

## SWIFT Theft

Information systems have made business faster and more efficient in almost any industry, from agriculture to banking. This has widely benefitted our society, but the flip side is that crime and theft can be faster and more efficient as well. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is an organization that enables banks to rapidly clear financial transactions on a global basis. The society is owned by its members, who pay fees to provide for the technological infrastructure that enables quick and seamless financial transactions, such as clearing international money orders or settling very large transactions between governments and large financial services entities. The system has been in place since the 1970s and, as of 2015, linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories, exchanging an average of more than 32 million financial transaction messages per day.

In February 2016, two banks in Southeast Asia learned the hard way that cybertheft can be massive and quick, with nearly uS$81 million disappearing almost instantly and without a trace. Attackers successfully penetrated the central banking system of Bangladesh and used the SWIFT system to initiate the transfer of nearly a billion dollars out of the country's accounts. uS$81 million worth of these transactions cleared before a spelling error caught the attention of a recipient institution and the transfers were halted. The hackers not only gained access to the system and initiated the transfers, but they used malware to cover up their activity as well-as all transactions were logged to a hard-copy printer, the hackers intercepted the print jobs, effectively making the transactions invisible. This type of combined social-engineering and malware-based attack is very difficult to defend against and serves to illustrate the disparity in the level of sophistication between the attackers and the bank employees charged with protecting their systems. A few months later, the attackers struck again and moved an undisclosed amount of money in the Philippines. The attacks continued into 2018 with thefts from banks in Chile and India resulting in an additional uS$23.5 million stolen.

one of the more disturbing aspects of these crimes is the fact that the SWIFT system itself was not compromised. However, attackers were able to exploit the weaknesses in security at a member organization bank and use that organization as a stepping-off point to the broader network. once they were inside the system, they were assumed to be trusted actors executing legitimate transactions. SWIFT is investigating the implementation of additional network level security protocols and procedures but is simultaneously reminding member banks of the pressing need to secure their own houses as well. unfortunately, the issues continue, with attackers not only exploiting the SWIFT system, but also cryptocurrency exchanges.

Inventors and startups can draw on many sources for support.

## Startups and Crowdfunding

In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of many highly successful innovative startups,  with  some  having  quickly  developed  into  multibillion-dollar  companies. Startups -typically technology-based new ventures with high potential for scalability and growth-are often cofounded by entrepreneurs, developers, designers, or others with a promising idea. In the past, startups have been founded around services or platforms enabled by information systems. Advances in technologies such as 3D printing   (see   Chapter   1  )   have enabled hardware startups that build their business models around innovative physical objects, ranging from Coin's electronic credit card to the Square Reader developed by payment startup Square (which in early 2016 filed to go public). At the same time, 3D printing has the potential to disrupt traditional supply chains, as consumers will eventually be able to produce products in their own homes using relatively  low-cost  3D  printers,  opening  up  an  even  larger  market  for  new,  innovative ventures.

However, even with the ability to relatively quickly develop prototypes of innovative products, going from invention to developing product designs and manufacturing processes and then manufacturing enough stock to meet the planned initial demand requires not only a great idea for an excellent product but also knowledge about the business environment, connections with the business community, and often substantial financial resources. To obtain the needed support, many startups turn to so-called startup incubators, which provide various types of education and other resources. Relatedly, startup accelerators typically provide education, investment, and intense mentorship for cohorts of startups. On the other hand, angel investors can be a valuable source for funding (but often only provide limited education or mentorship). Recently, crowdfunding-though platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogohas emerged as a novel form of obtaining project funding. Crowdfunding is the securing of business financing from individuals in the marketplace-the 'crowd'-to fund an initiative, typically some consumer-based product (see   Figure   2.  24  ). Individuals who support a given initiative-called 'backers'-pledge a certain amount of financial support to the project in return for certain benefits. In the case of Kickstarter, a funding campaign usually centers

<!-- image -->

around a product-such as a smartphone case, a belt, an electronic gadget, or even a board game. Interested backers pledge money in support of the product, generally above a minimum amount in return for one count of the item being backed. If (and only if) the campaign reaches its funding goal, the backers are charged the amount they pledged and the product goes into production. If too few backers are interested and the goal is not met, the campaign fails and no backers are charged any money. Kickstarter, in particular, has been very successful and has helped many campaigns get funded, totaling more than 135,000 projects with more than US$1 billion generated in pledges. Similarly, equity crowdfunding (sometimes called crowdinvesting) is the securing of financing from individuals, but the backers receive equity in return for their investment.

In this chapter, we examined how organizations can use information systems strategically, enabling them to gain or sustain competitive advantage over their rivals. As ongoing success depends on a sustained commitment to continuously learn and innovate, organizations must continuously search and apply the most effective business models.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Education

For decades, the cost of higher education in the united States has steadily increased, and the average college graduate entered the workforce with about uS$33,000 in student loans in 2020. Several emerging changes in the education industry hold the promise of bringing those costs down. Information systems are at the core of these exciting developments.

one way education is changing is through globalization. universities increasingly partner with other universities around the world, encouraging collaboration among researchers, consistency in curriculum design, and crossborder movement of students, graduates, and faculty. Many countries outside of the united States and other Western countries are investing heavily in their education systems, and there are now many universities in less developed parts of the world that can compete with the best of the 'old-school' Ivy League universities. The global economy has produced an equally global education system.

Along with the trend of globalization, many universities are extending their reach by implementing online courses or, in many cases, whole degrees that can be obtained via remote, self-directed courses delivered over the internet. These programs are typically far less expensive to administer because once the materials are produced and refined, they can be used repeatedly by large groups of (paying) students. Some argue that such courses are less engaging and/or less effective, and there may be some truth to that. In addition to self-directed courses, some online programs are more structured and allow nontraditional students or working professionals to further their education with a flexible schedule. Concerns about engaging coursework remain, however, and are especially challenging for in-person students that were suddenly transitioned to an online environment during the onset of CovID-19 (i.e., Zoom u). Regardless of the challenges, universities continue to forge ahead in finding new ways to reach more students.

Another recent trend in education is the proliferation of so-called massively open online courses (MooCs). These courses, which are freely available to the public, are able to effectively reach millions of students. Some very prestigious schools participate in providing these free courses, including Stanford, Wharton School of Business, uC Berkley, MIT, and Harvard. While the course content is provided free of charge, many of these institutions generate revenue by charging students for certifications or tutoring services.

Clearly, higher education is changing rapidly and in very significant ways, and technology has enabled each of these changes.

## Questions

1. Are online courses better or worse as compared with traditional, face-to-face courses? Why?
2. In what ways could technology be used to improve on the deficiencies of online courses?

## Key Points Review

1. Discuss how information systems can be used for automation, organizational learning, and strategic advantage. Information systems are used at different levels of an organization to support automating and organizational learning and to support strategy. To apply information systems strategically, you must understand the organization's competitive landscape as well as the value chain and be able to identify opportunities in which you can use information systems to make changes or improvements in the value chain to gain or sustain a competitive advantage.
2. Describe how information systems support business models used by companies operating in the digital world. Organizations utilize information systems investments as a central component for executing their business models and delivering their value proposition. Common revenue models include affiliate marketing, subscriptions, licensing, transactions fees, sales, and web advertising revenue. The freemium model for providing digital products or services has become a widely used strategy for quickly building a large user base and
3. monetizing additional features provided. Fueled by information systems, many organizations are extremely successful by building platforms or offering their products as services.
3. Explain why and how companies are continually looking for innovative ways to use information systems for competitive advantage. To gain or sustain competitive advantage, organizations must continuously innovate. As product innovations are often easily copied, organizations must combine various types of innovation in their business models. Given that new technologies are not as stable as traditional ones, being at the technological cutting edge is typically quite difficult to execute. To best deploy new technologies, organizations must be ready for the business process changes that will ensue, have the resources necessary to deploy new technologies successfully, and be tolerant of the risk and problems involved in being at the cutting edge. The lean startup methodology focuses on first searching for a viable product and business model before executing this business model.

## CASE 1 The Enduring Success of LinkedIn: From Job Search to an All-Round Professional Networking Platform

The Internet and the emergence of mobile, social, and cloud computing have enabled new business models, of which the platformbased business model is one of the most interesting. Many of today's revolutionary businesses are based on providing digital platforms through which users create value as well as consume user-created content. One example of a platform-based business is LinkedIn, a social networking service used for professional networking.

LinkedIn, Microsoft obtained access through the takeover to a huge amount of data: where people work, what they aspire to in life, and so on.

LinkedIn was founded in 2002 and launched in 2003. In its early days, it was mainly used by job seekers to post their CVs and by employers to post job applications. The founders targeted 'champions,' focusing on both companies and individuals that were popular and powerful to grab the attention of other potential users and draw them to the website. Though LinkedIn was developed with a focus on job searches, it has transformed over the years to become a social media platform where people can showcase their skills, talk about issues associated with work, build new connections, and develop their skills.  As of January 2022, it had over 810 million user accounts across more than 200 countries and territories, and it was available in 25 languages.

systems for job searches, but it managed to differentiate itself from other such services and grow its user base before similar services caught up. LinkedIn is fairly well protected against new competitors as users are reluctant to change to a totally new service when they have invested in creating content and networks through one service. The most relevant competitive threat comes from other established social networks with a wide user base; one example is Facebook (now Meta), which launched a new service called Facebook Jobs in the autumn of 2016. However, as recently as February 2022, this service was shut down outside the United States and Canada. Meta is now facilitating job listings through its Facebook Business Page.

LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft in 2016. In July 2021, the company happily announced that this acquisition had been a huge success. For the first time, the annual revenue of LinkedIn was higher than US$10 billion. In 2021, LinkedIn noted that its users were spending more and more time on the platform: in the period from April to July, the number of sessions increased by 30 percent, compared to the previous year. As the acquisition  of  LinkedIn  had  been  very expensive (Microsoft paid more than US$26 billion), both LinkedIn and Microsoft made sure that the world took note of the success story that LinkedIn had become.  Needless to say, regardless of the operational results of

The vast number of users is a critical factor for LinkedIn's success. Since platformbased businesses do not require the company itself to provide services and products, they depend largely on their users to offer and consume services. The network only has value if users participate, and this dictates the success or failure of the business. LinkedIn has been constantly growing its user base, which is not only enabling its business model but also strengthening its competitive advantage against possible rivals.

LinkedIn's revenue model is based on taking advantage of the many possibilities offered by information systems that support business models. According to LinkedIn, the company's revenues come from talent solutions, marketing solutions, and premium subscription products. Talent solutions offer recruiters and companies the ability to search for employees and advertise job openings. Marketing solutions let other companies add sponsored content and ads to the service. The premium subscription gives users access to advanced services, such as tools for job seeking that are not available in the free profile, for a fee. In 2021, the quarterly revenue from advertising surpassed US$1 billion for the first time. The company noted that in 2021, 200,000 new members were joining, 150,000 hours of learning were being consumed, and 11 million new connections being made on LinkedIn every day!

To stay ahead of the competition, it is important for LinkedIn to use information systems in innovative ways to differentiate its services. LinkedIn continuously provides users with new features in order to expand the ways people use the service. For example, as early as 2008 LinkedIn added an applications platform that lets users link external services such as blog postings to their profile. Another example  is  LinkedIn  Salary,  a  feature announced in November 2016, which lets users submit and browse salary information anonymously. In addition to adding new features in-house, LinkedIn added the creator mode in 2021. This mode puts less emphasis on the work experience of users and allows them to focus on content and build up their own community. It is now possible to upload a short video to replace the picture that is part and parcel of the traditional resumé.

With the help of information systems, LinkedIn has proven itself capable of providing added value to its users by transforming the simple job-search website into a social media platform dedicated to professional life and personal branding. When it was first launched in 2003, LinkedIn wasn't the first service to enter the market using information

## CASE 2 Streaming Video

Remember the old brick-and-mortar movie rental services? You drove to the physical location, scanned shelves for your movie of choice (too frequently, it wasn't in), paid the clerk, and left. The flick was due back in 24 hours (or, at most, 3 to 5 days later), or you were billed a hefty late fee. In some cases, forgetful customers answered the door to find a police officer asking why they hadn't returned a rental movie.

on fast shipping for all products, provides subscribers access to a vast library of movie and TV content. This content is available to users via mobile devices, smart televisions, computers, and even set-top boxes.

Movie rental stores still exist but in quickly dwindling numbers. Many alternatives have spawned, beginning with Netflix, the first and now the world's largest online movie service. Though originally started as a mail-order DVD rental service, Netflix has rapidly embraced the streaming video market. As of April 2020, Netflix offered its 183  million  subscribers  in  more  than 190 countries tens of thousands of movie and television titles and, in 2020, accounted for 12.6 percent of all downstream web traffic, having a large enough impact on global networks that regulators asked Netflix to reduce streaming quality (thus reducing demand on the web) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though Netflix continues to battle rising costs as movie and TV studios raise their licensing fees, the company continues to dominate in the streaming market.

Other competitors have entered the market as well. Amazon's Prime subscription service, in addition to providing discounts

Apple and Google also compete in this space, though currently with a slightly different approach. iTunes has long been the leader in  digital  music  distribution,  and  Apple moved seamlessly to movie and TV distribution as those became popular. The distinction from the Netflix and Amazon models is that iTunes provides a rental and purchasing marketplace, where customers can pay for temporary rights to a movie (rental) or may pay a higher price to purchase the movie for indefinite ownership. The Google Play store uses a similar rental/purchase model. The advantage of this model is that movie and TV studios are much more willing to participate in this type of distribution (which mirrors physical movie and TV distribution and the accompanying revenues). As a result, these marketplaces typically provide the latest, most popular movies. In contrast, a drawback of Netflix and Amazon's streaming services is their limited selection of popular or recent titles, as their streaming libraries are dependent on content deals they have made with individual studios.

These personalized services learn about a user's preferences according to the movies they frequently watch. From this data, the company creates a profile of each customer and a list of recommended movies. If, for example, a customer liked the movie Prometheus , he or she may also like the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien , and that movie will be included in a list of suggested movies. Customers can refine the recommendations by rating titles according to their preferences. These systems allow customers to tap large databases of movies, many of which they may not have been aware of at all.

One of the major advantages to these digital video distribution services is their ability to personalize a customer's experience to a degree previously not possible.

Consider how fast things are changing. Just a few years ago, the only way to watch a movie other than paying to purchase it was to drive to a movie rental store like Blockbuster or Hollywood Video and pay to borrow a DVD for a few days. Today, that same entertainment can be obtained via any computer or mobile device or through an increasing number of 'connected' TVs, Blu-ray players, or small video-streaming devices like the Amazon FireTV, Roku, AppleTV, or Google's Chromecast. These services and devices have completely disrupted the movie rental business. Hollywood Video, once a major competitor to Blockbuster Video with stores all over the United States, declared bankruptcy in 2010 and closed all of its stores. Blockbuster Video slowly bled customers until it, too, declared bankruptcy in 2010.
