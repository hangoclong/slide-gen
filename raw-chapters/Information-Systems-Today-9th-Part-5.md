## Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media

## Preview

This  chapter  focuses  on  social  media  and  how  social media can enhance organizational communication and collaboration. Most likely, you are actively using various social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram, or Wikipedia, and you may ask, 'Why do we need to have a chapter on this?' Social media introduce unprecedented ways to connect to friends, share knowledge with your colleagues, or collaborate with a team of engineers 5,000 miles  away,  and  many  of  today's  companies  cannot afford to miss this trend. Most young people entering the workforce have grown accustomed to using Facebook or Twitter for their communication needs (and some even regard email as an outmoded communication medium); if a company doesn't allow the use of these tools, some employees may leave and work for another company. Additionally,  you  may have noticed your parents' generation joining sites such as Facebook, as the masses are more and more taking those tools for granted.

With  social  media  providing  a  vastly  expanded set  of  capabilities  for  individuals  and  businesses,  an understanding  of  how  they  can  be  applied  can  be very helpful. Being able to understand and apply these emerging capabilities and strategies that are associated with social media is a highly valued skill.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Facebook

M anaging our lives in the modern, digital world seems  to  be  far  more  complex  than  it  was in  the  past.  The  same  is  true  for  companies. Interactions  with  customers  were  limited  to  one-way communication using TV ads, billboards, posters, or radio broadcasts. In return, people showed affinity to a brand by displaying bumper stickers, wearing T-shirts, or refusing to even try alternative brands. All in all, no real interaction could be recorded between customers and brands.

Things have changed since then. In early 2020, Facebook reported  impressive  usage  statistics.  Each  month,  more than  2.6  billion  users  access  the  site,  and  more  than 1.7 billion of those users access the service daily. On aver -age, Facebook users view more than eight billion hours of video per day, and one million people login every minute.

Many companies have also joined Facebook, creating pages to extend their reach and promote new products. In addition, celebrities, musicians, public figures, movies, and almost any other product or service you can think of now appears to have a Facebook page. Facebook has become another get-together space for people who have acquaintances, friends, or beliefs in common. Businesses use it to build and track customer loyalty, and connections are made even tighter with the help of 'like' buttons  that  seem  to  be  on  almost  every  site  on  the  web (Figure  5.1).  Facebook  has  changed  the  scope  of  social interactions,  as  consumer  preferences,  collective  tastes, and future demands are now more easily analyzed and

predicted through the number of 'likes' or the comments left by consumers responding to photos regarding the latest smartphone or that new movie premiering next Thursday. Through this social media platform, companies can interact with customers like never before.

In early 2020, most objective measures of Facebook's tremendous success appear to continue. Over the past year, the market value was estimated at half a trillion US dollars, with revenue up 27 percent from the prior year,  exceeding  US$70  billion.  As  of  2019,  Facebook is  the  sixth  most  valuable  company in America. Analysts predict that Facebook could be reaching market saturation,  yet  their  revenues  and  user  base  continues  to  grow.  Part  of  that  is  Facebook's  frequent experimentation  with new  products  and  services, their early adoption of virtual reality technology, and their  many  brilliant  acquisitions  such  as  Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and others.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

1. How can Facebook be used to address organizations' needs for communication and collaboration?
2. What are the social media and evolving web capabilities used by Facebook?
3. Facebook started as a 'pure' social networking site. What other social media applications are now integrated into Facebook, and how do they help enhance communication, collaboration, cooperation, and connection?

## The Need for Communication and Collaboration

Just as you communicate with your friends when planning a vacation or organizing a party or collaborate with your teammates on a class project, organizations rely on effective communication and collaboration (i.e., two or more people working together to achieve a common goal), both  within  and  outside  organizational  boundaries.  Most  organizational  business  processes require communication and collaboration between employees of different departments as well as with outside business partners (such as suppliers), customers, and other external stakeholders. Many organizations operate on a national or global scale and rely on effective and efficient communication between various locations or subsidiaries, and even small, local companies need to communicate with suppliers or promote their products or services to customers. Further, globalization has enabled companies to source raw materials, parts, or components on a global scale or manufacture products wherever they can find the lowest cost, best quality, or most qualified workforce. In all of these scenarios, effective and efficient communication is essential to convey specifications, coordinate production or delivery schedules, and so on. Similarly, salespeople rely on efficient communication with the customers and with other departments within the organization. With the increased global reach of organizations, the needs for internal communication have also changed tremendously.

## Managing the Virtual Organization

To be competitive, organizations constantly need to bring together the right combinations of people who have the appropriate set of knowledge, skills, information, and authority to solve problems quickly and easily. Traditionally, organizations have used task forces, which are temporary work groups with a finite task and life cycle, to solve problems that cannot be solved well by existing work groups. Unfortunately, traditional task forces, like traditional organizational structures, cannot always solve problems quickly, as structure and logistical problems often get in the way of people trying to get things done. Thus, organizations are increasingly trying to harness the expertise of highly specialized team members, regardless of their location. With various collaboration and communication tools enabled by the internet, collaborators on projects or teams do not have to be co-located; rather, businesses increasingly form virtual teams , composed of members from different geographic areas and assembled as needed to collaborate on a certain project (Figure 5.2). Membership on these virtual teams is fluid, with teams forming and disbanding as needed, team size fluctuating as necessary, and team members coming and going as they are needed. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic that started in early 2020 has amplified the need for connecting a virtual workforce, with people from around the world being forced to work from their homes for extended periods of time. Companies such as Facebook expect up to half

<!-- image -->

of their workforce to permanently work from home by 2030. For organizations, this has brought about new challenges, but also new opportunities.

Employees may, at times, find themselves on multiple teams, and the life of a team may be very short. In addition, team members must have easy, flexible access to other team members, meeting contexts, and information. Resembling highly dynamic task forces, virtual teams are commonly used for tasks such as developing systems and software; for example, the programmers are located in India, the project managers are in the United States, and the testers are in Europe. However, systems development is not the only place you will find virtual teams. For instance, the healthcare industry has embraced the idea of using technology to create superior care for patients by creating virtual teams that may include dieticians, physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, and social workers from different cities, all of whom can coordinate care of a patient using various web technologies to provide the best healthcare professionals regardless of where the patient resides.

If you have ever worked on a team project for your class (and you probably have), you have noticed that there are many different communication needs, such as discussing issues, sharing documents, and making decisions. Just as there are many things to discuss within your team project, there are also many ways that you can communicate and collaborate, and different time horizons. One key distinction is between the need for synchronous (i.e., at the same time) and asynchronous (i.e., not coordinated in time) communication. For example, chatting online or making a telephone call are examples of synchronous communication, whereas texting or sending emails are examples of asynchronous communication. Likewise, meetings of virtual teams typically take the form of virtual meetings using online environments; such meetings can be held synchronously, like a teleconference, or asynchronously, using technologies such as online discussion boards. If time is of the essence, such as when attempting to meet deadlines or resolve urgent customer problems, synchronous media may be best suited, as delays can create process inefficiencies or dissatisfied customers and can thus be costly for the organization. Thus, over the years, different tools have emerged to support various communication and collaboration needs (Table 5.1).

## Collaboration Software

Collaboration software and collaboration apps have evolved from groupware-a class of software that enables people to work together more effectively. Since the appearance of the first mainstream groupware product-Lotus Notes-in 1989, collaboration software has become ubiquitous in all types of organizations, with many (often free) tools allowing anyone with a connected device to utilize their benefits. Collaboration software is often distinguished along two dimensions:

1. Whether the software supports synchronous or asynchronous collaboration and communication
2. Whether the software supports groups working together face-to-face or distributed

TABLE 5.1 Categories of Collaboration Tools

## FIGURE 5.3

Collaboration software supports various modes of group interaction.

<!-- image -->

Using these two dimensions, collaboration software can be categorized as being able to support four modes of group interaction, as shown in Figure 5.3.

Depending on the purpose, organizations draw on different types of asynchronous tools, such as email, mailing lists, workflow automation systems, intranets (see upcoming discussion), group calendars, or collaborative writing tools. One widely used tool for group communication is discussion forums (also known as discussion boards or online forums), which emulate traditional bulletin boards and allow for threaded discussions between participants. Typically, discussion forums are dedicated to specific topics, and users can start new threads (Figure 5.4). Depending on the owner or host of the forum, the discussion forum may be moderated so that new postings appear only after they have been vetted by a moderator; further, some discussion forums may only

allow posts from registered users, whereas others allow anyone to contribute. As the purpose of such forums is to enable discussion and/or solve problems, many discussion forums now incorporate collaboration features such as the ability to mark answers as helpful or correct.

Like asynchronous groupware, there are also many forms of synchronous collaboration software available to support a wide variety of activities, including shared whiteboards, online chat, electronic meeting systems, and, of course, video communication systems (discussed in the following section). An electronic meeting system is a sophisticated software tool used to help group members solve problems and make decisions through interactive structured processes such as electronic idea generation, idea evaluation, and voting (Figure 5.5). These structured processes help groups stay on track and avoid costly diversions that regularly occur in meetings. EMS have traditionally been housed within a dedicated meeting facility; increasingly, webbased implementations support team members around the globe. Many collaboration systems used by organizations combine a variety of tools supporting both synchronous and asynchronous communication and collaboration.

## Videoconferencing

In the 1960s, at Disneyland and other theme parks and special events, the picturephone was first being demonstrated to large audiences. It took another 30 years to take off, but today, organizations are routinely conducting videoconferences to replace traditional meetings, using either desktop videoconferencing or dedicated videoconferencing systems.

Desktop videoconferencing has become a common way of collaborating, joining meetings remotely, or attending classes. For desktop videoconferencing, all that is needed is a webcam (i.e., a small video camera that is connected directly to a PC or integrated in a laptop PC's monitor), a speaker telephone or a separate microphone and speakers/headphones, videoconferencing software (e.g., Skype, Google+, or Apple FaceTime), and a high-speed internet connection. Similarly, people can now use various apps on their mobile devices, enabling them to make video calls on the go.

Dedicated videoconferencing systems are typically located within organizational conference rooms, facilitating meetings with customers or project team members across town or around the world. These systems can be highly realistic-as if you are almost co-located with your colleagues-but high-end systems can be extremely expensive, ranging from a few thousand dollars up to US$500,000. No matter what type of videoconferencing system is utilized by an organization, this collaboration technology has come a long way from the demonstration at Disneyland in the 1960s and has become mainstream in most modern organizations.

## Solving Renewable Energy Challenges

Everyone is excited about the potential for renewable energy to replace non-renewable sources such as coal, petroleum, and nuclear. Renewable energy is generated from natural processes that are continuously replenished, such as sunlight, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. For individuals and organizations, key considerations are reducing energy bills and reducing carbon footprint; reducing the carbon footprint is especially important for organizations attempting to portray a positive image by engaging in socially responsible behavior. Continuous improvements in various energy technologies are rapidly improving the efficiency and reducing the costs of renewable sources. With rapidly decreasing costs, many individuals and companies are going green by buying electric cars, installing solar panels and wind turbines, and so on.

One of the key challenges of renewable energy technologies is that, whereas variability in energy consumption can be predicted reasonably well, the environment's natural variability can only be predicted to a much lesser extent; consequently, matching supply and demand becomes crucial, so as to avoid either wasting energy (in case of excess supply) or having to fire up backup fossil fuel plants (in case of excess demand). Storing excess energy when it is available would be an obvious solution, but herein lies the problem: We have yet to find ways of storing large amounts of energy to balance the loads of the electric grid. Further, with more and more people installing solar panels in their homes and the increasing use of smaller wind turbines, electricity production is becoming increasingly decentralized. With IoT technology being designed to excel in distributed environments, these technologies promise solutions to these problems. For example, Tesla developed the Powerwall, which allows storing excess energy generated by domestic solar systems. Similarly, in a pilot project in Hawaii, 'smart' electric water heaters allow storing energy by increasing water temperature when supply exceeds demand; when demand increases, the water heaters require less energy, helping to balance supply and demand of electricity. likewise, IoT sensors, paired with other smart grid technologies, allow for analyzing energy needs and performance to optimize the balance between energy consumption and performance needs for a variety of devices. In addition, IoT devices, paired with AI and advanced analytics, can help increase efficiency and effectiveness of solar panels, wind turbines, and transmission equipment. Clearly, while challenges surrounding renewable energies abound, IoT and AI can help build solutions for a greener future.

## Intranets and Employee Portals

Internet technologies have given rise to another widely used tool for communicating and collaborating  within  organizational  boundaries.  Specifically,  many  large  organizations  have intranet-based employee portals.   As discussed in   Chapter   3  , 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services,' a  n intranet is a private network using web technologies, used to facilitate the secured transmission of proprietary information within an organization. An intranet looks and acts just like a publicly accessible website, but the intranet pages are behind the company's firewall, so only authorized users can access the content using their web browser. Modern intranets allow for dynamically creating customized intranet pages for each employee depending on job functions or even geographical location. Whereas all pages have the same look and feel and draw on the same underlying data, each employee can access only the data needed to perform his or her job function (following the principles of least permissions and least privileges  ; see   Chapter    10  ,  'Securing  Information  Systems'  ).  For  example,  if  an  employee  from  human resources logs on to the employee portal, he or she would see only content that pertains to his or her job, such as payroll information or hiring statistics.

All intranet pages are behind the company's firewall, and in the simplest form of an intranet, communications take place only within the confines of organizational boundaries and do not travel across the internet. However, increases in employees' mobility necessitate that an intranet be accessible from anywhere. Thus, most companies allow their employees to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to connect to the company's intranet while on the road or working from home (i.e., telecommuting). Once connected via a VPN, users can access resources as if they were located within the organization and connected to the organization's network.   Figure   5.  6 depicts a typical intranet system architecture   (see   Chapter   10 for more on firewalls and VPNs)  .

<!-- image -->

REAL-TIME ACCESS TO INFORMATION. A major benefit of corporate intranets is the ability to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of collaboration by providing real-time access to information. Unlike paper-based documents, which need to be continually updated and distributed to employees when changes occur, intranets make it less complicated to manage, update, distribute, and access corporate information. For instance, Boeing disseminates corporate news by distributing multimedia content over the company's intranet, allowing employees to view digital copies of company news releases as they occur, from the convenience of their desktops.

With intranet-based solutions such as those deployed at Boeing, up-to-date, accurate information can be easily accessed on a company-wide basis from a single source that is both efficient and user friendly. Companies can become more flexible with resources required to create, maintain, and distribute corporate documents, while in the process employees become more knowledgeable and current about the information that is important to them.

ENTERPRISE SEARCH. Another component supporting employee productivity by providing realtime access to information is the integration of enterprise search functionality. As more and more content is accessible via a company's intranet, relevant information becomes increasingly difficult to locate, especially if the information is in different languages and located on different servers or databases, as is the case in many large global organizations such as Nestlé. Hence, the requirements for enterprise search engines are very different from those of internet search engines such as Google or Bing. Enterprise search engines such as Microsoft's Enterprise Search or the Google Search Appliance are designed to retrieve content from various internal data sources, including documents, databases, or applications linked to the company's intranet. Such capabilities allow organizations to easily share millions of documents located throughout the organization. Thus, providing enterprise search functionality can enhance productivity and be an important factor contributing to users' satisfaction with the company's intranet.

COLLABORATION. One of the most common problems occurring in large corporations relates to the coordination of and collaboration on business activities in a timely fashion across divisions or functional areas. For instance, Boeing uses its intranet to facilitate collaborative efforts, such as in the process of designing new aircraft components. In this process, threedimensional digital models of aircraft designs frequently need to be shared between aerospace engineers. Using Boeing's intranet, an engineer can share a drawing with another engineer at a remote location; the second engineer revises the drawing as necessary and uploads the updated drawing to a shared folder on the intranet. The Boeing intranet provides the company with the capability of reducing product development cycle times as well as the ability to stay abreast of current project, corporate, and market conditions. Likewise, intranets are being used to poll staff about current issues or by employees to communicate with each other and executives in secure nonpublic forums.

## FIGURE 5.6

Typical intranet system architecture.

To further enable collaboration and communication, many intranet solutions now incorporate social components. In contrast to traditional intranets, where typically only select users with editorial privileges can create and update content, these intranets-sometimes referred to as social intranets -allow every user to create and update content and to easily connect with other content creators (see our discussion of social software below). Further, intranet solutions such as Jive are integrated with various other collaboration tools, ranging from Gmail to Dropbox, Skype, or customer relationship management software such as Salesforce.com (see Chapter 8, 'Strengthening Business-to-Business Relationships via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management').

EMPLOYEE PORTALS. In addition to being used for communication and collaboration, organizational intranets are widely used to provide employee portals that enable employee selfservice for administering benefits, managing retirement plans, or other human resources-based applications. For example, for large companies, processing human resources-related forms can be a large cost factor. Depending on the complexity of the form, processing a paper-based form can cost US$20 to US$30, according to benefits administration solutions provider Workscape, Inc. Whereas interactive voice response-based telephone applications can cut these costs to US$2 to US$4, using intranet-based employee self-service applications can reduce this further, to a few cents per form. Considering that an employee, on average, conducts 15 human resourcesrelated transactions per year, the savings can be significant. Using the intranet, form templates can be centrally managed, and modifications can be made instantaneously as conditions change; thus, employees can submit the appropriate form electronically with the assurance that they have used the correct version. Further, using online forms can help to significantly reduce error rates, as the entries can be checked for accuracy at the time of data entry, thus preventing the user from inputting incorrect or illogical entries. Using employee portals, employees become self-reliant, reducing time spent dealing with employment-related issues and allowing them to focus on their work responsibilities.

## The Evolving Web

The  traditional  collaboration  tools  previously  introduced  are  based  on  internet  technologies. Up until the early 2000s, the web was regarded as a one-way medium (sometimes referred to as 'Web 1.0'), with a relatively strict distinction between content creators and content consumers. Some entities would create content (e.g., a website), and others would consume this content. However, changes in technology have enabled new uses of the web; dynamic web applications, often referred to as Web 2.0 applications, allow people to collaborate and share content online, shifting the users' role from passive consumers of content to content creators (Figure 5.7). In contrast to the TV network ABC's site, where content is provided by ABC, the Web 2.0 application YouTube depends on user-generated content , content that is created and uploaded by other users; similarly,  whereas Encyclopaedia  Britannica invests  large  sums  in  professionally  researched articles, the articles in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are jointly written and edited by the online community (owing to societal changes and competition from Wikipedia, Encyclopaedia Britannica decided  to  stop  producing  printed  encyclopedias  in  2012,  instead  focusing  on  its online offerings). In addition to these applications, many organizations have successfully incorporated Web 2.0 concepts into their business models. For example, Amazon adds value to its site by incorporating product reviews from its customers. This way, it gives customers a channel to voice their thoughts; at the same time, a larger number of reviews can help other customers make better decisions, thus attracting more visitors to Amazon's site. Likewise, platform-based business models (such as pursued by Airbnb, Uber, or YouTube; see Chapter 2, 'Gaining Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems') are based on Web 2.0 concepts. In the following sections, we will discuss technological and societal changes that both enable and necessitate changes in the way many organizations do business.

## Evolving Web Capabilities

Many successful Web 2.0 applications rely on the network effect. The network effect (as defined in Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World') refers to the notion that the value of a network (or tool or application based on a network) increases with the number of other users. In other words, if a network has few users, it has little or no value. Using APIs, many successful websites

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Neural Implants

Imagine having a neural implant that would give you the ability to seamlessly communicate with others from around the world using a universal language; having an implant that could restore eyesight or hearing, eliminate paralysis, or repair other traumatic brain injuries; or perhaps a neural implant that could give you the ability to boost your memory capacity. Although these scenarios seem like science fiction technology borrowed from Star Trek, the reality is that Elon Musk's neural technology company, neuralink, is developing implant technology with the goal of enhancing brain function for these and other scenarios.

While there are certainly many positive consequences resulting from this type of technology, there are also a few negatives worth considering. Besides the obvious holes that would have to be drilled into your head in order to use the implant, what happens to the wearer if there is a security breach of the implant system? What kind of data are stored and used by the implant, and who is in possession of that data? What happens if there is a physical malfunction of the implant? Although many unanswered questions remain, the potential benefits of neural implants could change lives for the better.

Researchers at neuralink have begun testing their implants in collaboration with researchers at university of California, davis, and have already shown that primates can use implants to control computer systems. Although human trials have yet to be conducted, Musk is confident that his uS$100 million investment in the technology will be successful. In addition to repairing brain function, he believes the implant will also allow for a type of telepathic communication between individuals using radio communication. Further, the implant can be wirelessly connected to a personal device (such as a smartphone) and leverage artificial intelligence to have a positive effect on one's mental capabilities and quality of life. For example, consider a traumatic brain injury resulting in paralysis. In this case, multiple implants could be leveraged to restore motor control, improving the wearer's independence and daily functioning.

The idea of mashups came from popular music where many songs are produced by mixing two or more existing songs together; in Web 2.0 terminology, a mashup is a new application (or website) that uses data from one or more service providers. For example, a mashup could combine map data, photos, reference information, hotel prices, and weather information to

## FIGURE 5.8

provide a comprehensive overview of travel destinations. Rather than having to collect or generate all of this information single-handedly, the creator of the mashup could simply access the APIs of companies such as Google Maps, Flickr, Wikipedia, Expedia, and AccuWeather to draw on services provided by these companies (Figure 5.8). The online itinerary planner Sygic integrates data from OpenStreetMap, hotel booking services, and other services to let users plan their next holiday. Likewise, users and companies can create mobile apps by combining various services and data sources. The local search app AroundMe uses data from services such as Booking.com, Opentable.com, or Foursquare to display information, reviews, or driving directions about businesses, restaurants, or medical facilities near a given location. Other websites and mobile apps use data from airlines, radio stations, recommendation services, or any other sources of useful information.

Many organizations have recognized the power and benefits of allowing other sites and apps to incorporate their services and data into mashups. Why are companies doing this? By providing access to useful services and data, organizations extend their reach and build and strengthen customer relationships, providing a base for revenue-generating services (e.g., Google offers mapping services for free for low-volume usage but offers the services as a paid version for high-volume commercial usage, such as integration in a hotel booking site).

## Evolving Social Interaction

Many successful Web 2.0 applications embody core Web 2.0 values such as collaboration and social sharing; these can be classified as social media (or social software ), allowing people to communicate, interact, and collaborate in various ways. With Web 2.0 coming of age, people's behaviors as well as societies have undergone rapid changes. For example, many people have changed the ways they search for information. Whereas, in the past, people turned to paper encyclopedias as sources of unbiased information, people now turn to websites such as Wikipedia or  ask  their  friends  and  acquaintances  on  social  networks  such  as  Facebook  for  personalized information. Similarly, there has been a marked shift in the way people view privacy and share information; although criticized by privacy advocates, people are sharing more personal information online than ever before. Repeatedly, you can read about people posting the most private information without thinking about the consequences; as Facebook and other social websites have become pervasive in many people's lives, you have information about your friend's recent drinking escapades leading to a driving under the influence (DUI) arrest, your coworker's breaking up with his girlfriend, and other things you may or may not want to know, all at your fingertips. Clearly, social software has strongly influenced the lives of many people, and social media have now reached a point where almost everything is interconnected. Further, ongoing conversations on social media generate vast amounts of Big Data, which can be used not only by the social media companies themselves but also by organizations using social media to connect with their stakeholders. Table 5.2 highlights the shift in perspectives from the Web 1.0 to the Web 2.0 era.

## The Evolving Workspace

The  'millennials,'  or  'Generation  Y,'  who  grew  up  being  tied  to  social  software  such  as Myspace (once the world's largest social network site, which now primarily focuses on music), YouTube, or Facebook, have started joining the workforce and have much different expectations for their workplace than prior generations, and some fundamental shifts are taking place

in  employer-employee relationships (see Accenture, 2016). For example, employees are now looking for a portfolio career rather than a cradle-to-grave job, tend to view themselves as citizens rather than employees, and 'loan their talent' to the employer rather than being a 'human resource.' Accenture feels that this new generation of 'born digital' workers have new expectations about how work should be organized and performed. For instance, companies no longer just serve customers, compete with rivals, or are limited to industry boundaries. Today, successful companies collaborate with customers, partner with rivals, and evolve their business as needed. Thus, to be successful, companies must create a corporate culture that is embracing the trends of  the  digital  world.  For  instance,  millennials  bring  with  them  many  new  and  valuable  skills but also attitudes that may be difficult to integrate with more traditional business environments. A great example of this relates to the use of social networking in the office. If a business bans the use of social networking sites at work, many millennials will easily find creative workarounds to circumvent such policies or simply find a job that is embracing the trends of the digital world. Many believe that embracing social media and other changes is not only necessary to attract and retain top talent, it is also good for business (Chignell, 2018). Viewing social media as a means of enhancing company culture, improving customer relationships, and recruiting future customers and employees provides many benefits. It also provides companies with deeper insight into what their competition is doing and what matters to their customers, all of which can aid in planning for the future.

## Future Web Capabilities

Web technologies and collaboration are ever-evolving topics, and many developments have yet to be fully realized. This section briefly forecasts future capabilities of the web, in particular, focusing on efforts to create the semantic web and characteristics of Web 3.0.

THE SEMANTIC WEB. Since the web opened for public use, the number of web pages and sites has grown exponentially. Although this increase in web pages should mean that we have ever more information at our fingertips, it also means that the information is increasingly harder to find. What if the information on the web was organized in a way that users could more easily find information or relevant content? Traditionally, web pages were designed to be understood by people but not by computers, and search engines were examining pages for the existence of key terms; for example, when searching for 'what eats penguins,' a search engine would return web pages that might have this information, but more likely various pages just having the words or key terms 'what' and 'eats' and 'penguins,' as search engines were not sophisticated enough to be able to find, understand, and integrate content presented on web pages. The semantic web , originally envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the World Wide Web, is a set of design principles that will allow computers to better index web pages, topics, and subjects. When web pages are designed using semantic principles, computers will be able to understand the meaning of the content, and search engines will be able to give richer and more accurate answers. The major search engines encourage webmasters -the individuals responsible for creating and maintaining web pages-to integrate so-called microdata into their pages' HTML markup to help search engines understand the meaning of content on the pages; for example, the

markup of a business' address can be enhanced by using microdata to specify the meaning of the different parts of an address. In 2012, Google has started making strides toward implementing concepts related to the semantic web in its 'knowledge graph.' When searching for terms in Google, the search engine now attempts to understand what the user may mean; for example, when searching for 'kings,' the search engine not only provides a list of pages containing the keyword 'kings' but also displays a box containing links to search results specific to the Los Angeles Kings , the Sacramento Kings , and the NBC TV series Kings . Similarly, when searching for 'Los Angeles Kings,' Google returns not only a list of web pages but also a summary of relevant information about the hockey team, culled from various web sources. Although the semantic web is largely unrealized (and may never be fully realized due to issues surrounding complexity, feasibility, or privacy concerns), Google's efforts show that computers are getting ever closer to understanding the meaning of content on the web.

WEB 3.0. In many ways, Web 2.0 has already replaced Web 1.0, and the question is 'What will replace Web 2.0?' For some, Web 2.0 has just been a short transitional period before the next wave of internet technologies, which is sometimes termed Web 3.0. There are several ideas on what this next wave will entail. Some envision Web 3.0 to be centered around mobility, almost announcing the demise of the web as we know it. Others see Web 3.0 as the 'contextual web,' where the immense amounts of content available to users will be filtered by contextual factors such as time, location, social activities, and so on. Further, Web 3.0 is often seen as characterized by not only semantic web concepts, but increasingly using artificial intelligence to further enhance the capabilities of the web. You may have already seen some of these emerging technologies in practice, especially regarding the context of a user's location, and we can see exciting new developments on the horizon. The coming trends will likely involve true integration of devices and connectivity to create powerful, socially aware internet applications. Stay tuned to see what the future holds.

## Social Media and the Enterprise

Having realized the opportunities brought about by Web 2.0 applications, many business organizations are continuously looking for ways to use social media to support their existing business processes;  many  organizations  have  built  successful  business  models  entirely  based  on  core Web 2.0  values  such  as  social  sharing  or  collaboration  (see  Chapter  4,  'Enabling  Businessto-Consumer Electronic Commerce,' for a discussion on social commerce). In addition, the use of social media within a company's boundaries or between a company and its customers or stakeholders can help in sharing organizational knowledge, making businesses more innovative and productive, and helping them to effectively connect with their customers and the wider public.

You were likely familiar with many of the social media applications mentioned throughout the previous chapters, but there may have been some that you were not aware of. You are probably more comfortable with or find more value using some tools over others. Similarly, organizations are increasingly trying to find the right tools for their different needs. In the following sections, we will discuss how different social media applications enable or support communication, cooperation, collaboration, or connection; needless to say, many of these applications cannot be neatly categorized, fitting into more than one category.

## Enhancing Communication Using Social Media

A prime application  of  social  media  in  the  enterprise  is  facilitating  and  enhancing  the  communication within an organization as well as between an organization and its stakeholders. For organizations, social media have opened up a vast array of opportunities for presenting themselves to their (potential) customers; at the same time, these applications have opened up literally thousands of channels for people to voice their opinions about an organization. In this section, we introduce various social media tools used for communication.

BLOGS. Blogging originally started out as a way for novices to express themselves using very simple web pages. Blogging is the process of keeping an online text diary (i.e., a blog , or web log) made up of chronological entries that comment on everything from one's everyday life to wine and food or even computer problems (Figure 5.9). Rather than trying to produce physical books to sell or use as gifts, bloggers (i.e., the people maintaining blogs) blog about their lives or voice their opinions (although feedback is often encouraged through associated threaded discussions).

Many bloggers use their blogs to hone their writing skills, often producing elaborate, thoughtful pieces of writing. Others write blogs with the aim of attracting large audiences to monetize their efforts using online advertising or affiliate marketing programs.

However, blogs are not without controversy. Nicholas Carr, noted technology journalist (and active blogger himself), classifies blogging as the 'amateurization' of journalism . Often, the value of blogging is the ability to bring breaking news to the public in the fastest possible way. By doing so, some bloggers cut journalistic corners, rendering some of the posts on the blogs less than accurate, and blogs have been criticized for frequently providing the biased opinions of the writers, particularly because many of the authors' sources cannot be or have not been verified.

Nevertheless, bloggers have massively influenced the way in which people gather and consume information and have become important voices that can sway public opinion. In fact, turning to free information from blogs and other online sources, many readers have canceled newspaper subscriptions. In turn, diminishing readership in traditional newspapers has enticed advertisers to begin to withdraw from this traditional medium, leading to budget cuts and layoffs at reputable newspapers such as the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Times, the Washington Times, and many others. Unfortunately-and ironically-this may erode the very sources that many bloggers base their information on.

In addition to blogs created by and/or for individual readers, blogs are being used by small, medium-sized, and large organizations for connecting with their employees or customers. For example, IBM's business-oriented social software suite IBM Connections includes blogs, helping people to voice ideas and obtain feedback from others. Similarly, companies such as Google maintain official company blogs (e.g., http://googleblog.blogspot.com) to inform their stakeholders about news, rumors, or current thoughts. In contrast to press releases or other official public relations statements, blogs provide an avenue for companies to present themselves in a more approachable way.

MICROBLOGGING. Microblogging , similar to blogging, enables people to voice their thoughts; however, in contrast to blogs, which often contain lengthy posts, microblogging services are designed for broadcasting relatively short 'status updates,' which are distributed in (near) real time. In contrast to social networks, where users can choose who can or cannot receive their status updates, typically, anyone can follow another person's microblog. A popular microblogging service is Twitter, which allows users to post short (up to 280 characters of text) 'tweets' that are delivered to the author's followers or subscribers (Figure 5.10). The recipient can 'retweet' (i.e., re-broadcast) interesting tweets to his or her followers. With many people broadcasting everything they find interesting and the high speed of message transmission, Twitter has become a source for breaking news. In China, where Twitter is blocked, the most popular microblogging service is Sina Weibo, which is widely used not only by individuals and companies but also by various levels of government to portray a positive image or monitor public sentiments. Many social networking sites (discussed later) also have microblogging functionality built in; for example, users can update their status on Facebook, letting their friends know about their current thoughts and allowing them to post replies.

Many organizations have used this trend and created accounts on Twitter. For example, Coca-Cola has an official Twitter account it uses to post news or interact with its (as of mid2020) more than 3.3 million followers; Coca-Cola follows more than 60,000 Twitter accounts and actively replies to and retweets Twitter messages. This way, Coca-Cola signals that it cares about its followers, trying to increase its customers' brand loyalty. When posting a tweet, users can tag words or phrases with a '# '-called a hashtag (e.g., #NBAFinals, #ThursdayThoughts, or #WearOrange)-to indicate the topic and relate the tweet to other tweets about the same topic. A word phrase or topic that is tagged at a greater rate than others is said to be trending . A topic becomes trending because of a concerted effort by users or because of an event (e.g., a new winner of the Super Bowl or a missing aircraft) that prompts people to tweet about the topic. Microblogging, however, is not limited to text content. Apps such as Vine allow users to easily share short video clips, taken with the smartphone's camera. Likewise, Tumblr allows users to share any kind of digital content, including text, music, and videos; by combining features of blogs, microblogs, and social networking sites, Tumblr allows companies to communicate and connect with their customers. For example, in May 2014, AMC premiered a full-episode sneak preview of its new TV series Halt and Catch Fire on Tumblr.

INSTANT MESSAGING. In contrast to asynchronous discussion forums, blogs, and status updates, instant messaging (or online chat) enables real-time written conversations. Using instant messaging, multiple participants can have conversations and enjoy immediate feedback from their conversation partners. Some social networking sites such as Facebook have integrated instant messaging functionality. In addition, the increase in smartphone usage has merged instant messaging with cell phone-based text messaging; cloud-based messaging services such as WhatsApp allow for group chats, free text messages or video calls (even internationally), and the exchange of multimedia content, using the smartphone users' data plan or Wi-Fi connection. Other popular instant message services include Viber, Line, or WeChat (hugely popular in China). Some instant messaging apps such as Snapchat or Telegram allow users to set a time limit specifying for how long the recipient can view the message before it is automatically deleted. Many organizations have adopted web-based instant messaging for internal communications; for example, the popular business communication platform Slack allows for creating different teams, workspaces, and communication channels to facilitate organizational collaboration. In addition to traditional communication channels, organizations use live chat with human customer service agents for sales and customer support functions and increasingly use automated chatbots (discussed in Chapter 6, 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence') to initiate conversations and gather preliminary information from the customer to route him or her to the relevant human customer service representative.

## Enhancing Cooperation with Social Media

In addition to communication, companies and individuals can benefit from social media applications that enable cooperation. Cooperation between individuals or organizations creates win-win situations such that one participant's success improves the chances of success of other participants. As with other social media applications, social media applications facilitating such cooperation rely on the network effect to provide the greatest benefits for users.

MEDIA SHARING. One example of cooperative social media applications making use of the network effect is the sharing of user-generated content such as pictures, videos, audio, or even presentations. Sharing media has become immensely popular on the web, using applications such as Flickr or Instagram (images), Vimeo or YouTube (videos), or SlideShare (presentations); using sites such as Pandora, users can even create their favorite music stream and share it with others who may have similar interests. Typically, the shared content is hosted on mediasharing sites; however, the content can also be embedded into other sites, creating a win-win situation for the content creator and the site embedding the content. For example, embedding an interesting and relevant YouTube video into a blog post helps increase the attractiveness of the blog while at the same time increasing the viewership of the video, thus creating positive returns for both parties.

Similarly, webcasting is increasingly used for media sharing. Webcasting (or podcasting) is the distribution of digital media content, such as audio or video files for on-demand playback on digital media players. The ability to consume the content at one's convenience has contributed to the tremendous growth of webcasts (or podcasts ). The term podcasting , derived from combining the terms broadcasting and iPod , is a misnomer, as podcasts can be played on a variety of devices in addition to Apple's iPods. As with blogging, webcasting has grown substantially, with traditional media organizations now webcasting current programs from National Public Radio to Fox's Family Guy as well as past programs such as the Oprah Winfrey Show (which ended in 2011). In addition to media organizations and independent webcasters, the educational sector uses webcasts for providing students access to lectures, lab demonstrations, or sports events; this allows students to review lectures or prepare for class during their morning and evening commutes. In 2007, Apple launched iTunes U, which combines various course management tools; iTunes U is used by major U.S. universities, such as Stanford, Berkeley, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with many universities offering free content ranging from lectures to faculty presentations (Figure 5.11). As webcasts can be enriched by allowing for interactive Q&amp;A sessions or by embedding PowerPoint presentations, organizations increasingly use webcasts to provide access to shareholder meetings, online training, road shows, or other events.

To receive the most current content, users can subscribe to blogs, webcasts, videos, and news stories through Apple's iTunes, or via RSS ( Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary ) feeds. Content publishers provide RSS feeds to notify users of updates to the content. Rather than users actively having to check multiple sources for updated content, RSS readers automatically check the feeds for updates and provide a synopsis of a document or the full text.

Recently, various apps, such as Periscope and Facebook, have enabled the possibility of sharing live video. Using Facebook Live, the White House broadcasts live videos from press conferences or president's speeches, and companies use live video to broadcast everything from hot topics to interviews or public performances. Broadcasting live videos via social media can enable various forms of direct interactions with the audience, such as by enabling the content creator to directly engage with the audience by responding to questions or comments during the broadcast. Yet, for the social media apps, monitoring content broadcast via live video is highly problematic: How can the spread of objectionable or illegal content be avoided? A case in point

is the live broadcast of a double murder in Paris, France, in June 2016; the killer, a selfproclaimed follower of ISIS, used Facebook Live to broadcast himself murdering a police commander and the commander's wife. Given the rapid pace at which such content is generated, continuously monitoring and stopping (or deleting) such broadcasts is virtually impossible for service providers.

TAGGING. One problem with user-generated content is its variety; status updates, photos, videos, and other content are typically not easy to categorize or find. Metadata -which can be simply thought of as data about data-describe data in terms of who, where, when, why, and so on, and can be useful for categorizing content and making it easier to find. For example, metadata about a Word document include the author, the time the document was created, and when it was last saved; metadata about a digital photo include date and time, focal length, shutter speed, aperture value, GPS coordinates, and so on; metadata about a phone call include call time, duration, location of participants, phone numbers, or the phones' unique identifiers (Figure 5.12).

Whereas certain metadata about documents or media files are captured automatically (e.g., when saving a document in a word processor or when taking a picture with a digital camera), there are various other useful pieces of information that are not automatically captured, such as keywords about a document or the names of people in a picture. Thus, manually adding tags , or metadata, to digital media or other content is an important aspect of many social media applications. Tags are commonly added to pictures and videos on websites such as Flickr, a picture- and video-hosting website that allows users to upload their content. Likewise, hashtags, popularized by social media applications such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram, are used to add metadata to messages posted on these services, allowing users to search for content related to a certain topic. A way to visualize user-generated tags or content on a site is through tag clouds (Figure 5.13). The size of a word in a tag cloud represents its importance or frequency, making it easy to spot the most important or frequent words or tags.

GEOTAGGING. Another type of metadata about media such as photos, videos, or even blogs or tweets is of geospatial nature; knowing where exactly a photo was taken and in what direction the camera was pointing, or knowing the location of a person sending out a breaking news update on Twitter can be extremely valuable. Such geospatial metadata (such as latitude, longitude, or altitude) added to digital media is referred to as geotags . Once the geographical coordinates of an item are known, it can easily be visualized on a map. For example, Google Maps can display various types of geotagged content, such as photos, webcams, Twitter posts, or Wikipedia articles about places or landmarks. Thus, Google can offer a map experience containing pictures of attractions, reviews, and things to do without having to take a single picture or write a single

review itself. Geotags are often automatically generated, for example, when taking images with a smartphone; yet this may lead to privacy or security concerns, for example, when sharing images online. A case in point is the arrest of John McAfee, the creator of the antivirus software, who was sought by authorities in Belize in connection with a murder. McAfee went into hiding and, in 2012, met with a team of journalists in Guatemala; one of the journalists posted a picture with him online but forgot to remove the location metadata, revealing McAfee's hideout to the Guatemalan authorities, who arrested him for illegally entering the country. After a week in a Guatemalan prison, McAfee was deported to the United States.

SOCIAL BOOKMARKING. As with other social media applications, social bookmarking relies on the network effect. For many web surfers, key challenges are finding information and then finding it again later; hence, people often keep long lists of bookmarks to sites they find interesting or visit frequently. Although this is useful for individuals, users may miss a plethora of other, related, and potentially interesting websites. Social bookmarking helps address this by allowing users to share interesting content and to create categorization systems (referred to as folksonomies ). As more people participate in social bookmarking, the value for each user grows as the bookmarks become more complete and more relevant to each user. Widely used public social bookmarking tools include Reddit and StumbleUpon. Likewise, Pinterest allows users to 'pin' content they find interesting, and media websites such as CNN.com provide sharing links to increase the reach of their content. For organizations, social bookmarking can be extremely valuable for knowledge management and harnessing the collective intelligence of employees. Using enterprise-oriented social bookmarking tools, it is easy to map 'islands' of knowledge within an organization, thus helping to easily find experts on a given topic.

SOCIAL CATALOGING. Like social bookmarking, social cataloging is  the  creation of a categorization system by users. Contributors build up catalogs regarding specific topics such as academic citations, wireless networks, books and music, and so on. For example, users can create virtual bookshelves with the social cataloging application https://www.goodreads.com organize their collections, write reviews, and then share this bookshelf with others on the web. Similarly, students and researchers can use free tools such as Mendeley or Zotero to manage their citations, thus facilitating the creation of reference lists for research papers. Organizations are typically dealing with tremendous amounts of information, ranging from supplier information to frequent customer complaints, and can use social cataloging for structuring this information and making it more accessible and useful.

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Terrorism Is Winning the Social Media Battle

Terrorism is the use of violence or threat of violence to purport a political, religious, or ideological change. In addition to acts of violence and aggression that deliberately target civilians, a key way to influence policymakers and advance the terrorists' goals is provoking irrational fear among large numbers of people. As such, terrorists need to gain publicity about their cause to be successful, and terrorists have learned to use media to their advantage and rely on media to spread their message and further their goals. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rash of commercial airliners hijacked. Often, these hijackings would be broadcast live on TV, and many believed that this exposure actually increased the number of hijackings (screening of passengers and luggage at the airports was mandated in an attempt to stop the hijackings).

videos to serve a dual purpose, inspiring one group of people to join their cause while disgusting and frightening the others. numerous videos of executions have been released, including those of Western aid workers, journalists, alleged spies, suspected homosexuals, and anyone else the terrorists believe to be their enemy. Various types of dramatic murders have been displayed, including decapitations, shootings, and even burning victims alive. An infamous video produced by media-savvy Taliban included terrorist-produced drone footage of a suicide attack on a police station in Afghanistan. At the same time, terrorists increasingly use popular social media (such as TikTok) to reach vulnerable teens and shape their opinions, with thousands of lonely teens having been recruited via social media to join ISIS as 'foreign fighters.'

Over the past decades, terrorists have further refined their skills of leveraging the available media to reach as many people as possible. While terrorism has not been effective at taking down governments and capturing political power, it has been very successful at gaining increasing attention and spreading fear. Today, due to the convenience, affordability, and broad reach of social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, terrorist groups are increasingly using social media to further their goals and spread their message. new technologies have not only made it astonishingly easy to produce high-quality propaganda images and videos; they have also made it far easier to disseminate this propaganda. Cheap, portable cameras and easy-to-use editing software allow for the rapid production of content. digital distribution on social media sites allows content to be distributed globally or broadcast in real time at little cost or effort. With smartphones connected to the internet, content can be viewed by millions around the world.

While attempts have been made by various governments and agencies to thwart the use of social media by terrorist organizations, these attempts have (mostly) not been successful. As the future continues to unfold, we can be sure that violent extremists will continue to evolve their use of the latest media and platforms in an attempt to further their cause.

## Enhancing Collaboration with Social Media

Traditional office technologies, such as telephones or email, are very useful to organizations; yet such technologies are not well suited to support rich, rapid, multi-person team collaboration. For example, the telephone is best suited for person-to-person communication; email is a useful technology for teams, but it does not provide the structure needed for effective multiperson, interactive problem solving. Modern organizations need technologies that enable team members to interact through a set of media either at the same place and time or at different times and in different locations, with structure to aid in interactive problem solving and access to real-time information. The internet, cloud computing, and the increase in the use of mobile devices have enabled various social media applications that provide many capabilities that have forever transformed the way individuals and teams can work together. These are described next.

CLOUD-BASED COLLABORATION TOOLS. One key trend that has greatly facilitated collaboration is the rise of cloud computing. Traditionally, sharing and collaborating on documents were cumbersome; users typically had to email documents back and forth or had to worry about

having the latest version of the software installed. Cloud-based collaboration tools have greatly facilitated collaboration; for example, cloud-based collaboration tools allow for easy access and easy transfer of documents or other files from one person to another; using services such as Dropbox, documents are not only stored on a user's computer but also synced to other computers or devices via a copy of the document stored in the cloud. This way, a user can access a file from multiple devices, always having the latest version at his or her fingertips, or collaborators can work on documents without needing to email documents. Similarly, tools such as Evernote, Things, or Microsoft OneNote allow for synchronizing and sharing of notes, task lists, and the like. Cloud-based productivity suites take this concept a step further by not only storing the files in the cloud but also enabling the access of office productivity tools from any computer (or even mobile device) with a web browser and internet connectivity. While this frees the user from having to locally install productivity software, using cloud-based collaboration tools requires a live internet connection to work on shared documents, and thus users may not be able to work when traveling or when having internet connectivity problems. Table 5.3 outlines various benefits and risks of cloud-based collaboration tools.

Organizations and individuals can choose from different options for using cloud-based collaboration tools. On one end of the spectrum, companies offer single-purpose tools for everything from creating presentations to managing projects. On the other end of the spectrum, cloud-based collaboration tools such as Google Apps or Microsoft Office 365 integrate everything from document sharing to videoconferencing, thereby mirroring (or even surpassing) the capabilities of traditional offline office suites (Table 5.4).

CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. A content management system (CMS) allows users to publish, edit, version track, and retrieve digital content, such as documents, images, audio files, videos, or anything else that can be digitized. For example, organizations use open source content management systems such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal to create blogs or websites (see also upcoming discussion of open source software); Carnival Cruise Lines uses WordPress for publishing company news; the French automaker Peugeot uses Joomla for its company website; and the University of Minnesota uses Drupal. Whereas traditionally, webmasters would have the task of adding, modifying, or deleting content on a company's website, content management systems provide easy-to-use interfaces that allow the creators of content to make necessary changes; thus, a member of the marketing team may edit a product's description without having to ask the IS department to make the changes. Typically, such content management systems facilitate the creation and management of web content by allowing the assignment of different roles to different users; these roles are associated with different permissions, such that some users can create and edit content, others can edit but not create, and yet others can only view content contained in the system. Many open source content management systems can even be used for building e-commerce sites by incorporating functionality such as inventory management or shopping cart functionality. Yet content management systems, also known by several other names, including digital asset management systems, document management systems, and enterprise content systems, can be used for collaboration beyond the creation and management of websites. For example, Microsoft SharePoint is a document management platform that can be used to host intranet sites, extranet sites, or public websites that enable shared workspaces and integrate other collaborative applications such as document sharing, wikis (see upcoming discussion), and blogs. SharePoint also includes workflow functionality such as to-do lists, discussion boards, and messaging alerts (Figure 5.14). Because SharePoint has been designed to be easily customizable, it has been installed in a variety of businesses, which can personalize the collaborative SharePoint websites to meet their needs.

Learning Management Systems Similar to content management systems used for communication and collaboration, learning management systems such as Blackboard, Sakai, and Moodle have facilitated business processes in educational settings. Typically, learning management systems enable uploading and viewing content, administering exams, and selfservice functions such as registering for courses or viewing grades. Increasingly, learning management systems offer additional tools for enabling team collaboration, class discussions, and the like.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE. One major benefit of social software is the ability to harness the 'wisdom of crowds,' or collective intelligence (Surowiecki, 2004). The concept of collective intelligence is based on the notion that distributed groups of people with a divergent range of information and expertise can outperform the capabilities of individual experts. For organizations, making effective use of the collective intelligence of their employees, customers, and other stakeholders can prove extremely valuable. Based on the concept of collective intelligence, peer production is the creation of goods or services by self-organizing communities. In peer production, the creation of the goods or services is dependent on the incremental contributions of the participants such that anyone can help in producing or improving the final outcome. Prime examples of peer production are open source projects and wikis.

Open Source Software Traditionally, software-ranging from Adobe Acrobat to large ERP systems-has been developed by software companies. In contrast, open source software, such as the Firefox web browser, the Linux operating system, or the Apache OpenOffice productivity suite, is created, maintained, and updated by thousands of volunteers located all over the world (see Chapter 9, 'Developing and Acquiring Information Systems'). Often, someone with an idea for a useful program develops an initial version; other developers looking for interesting projects to work on may then join the original creator and contribute to the continuing development of the software. Organizations now have access to various high-quality open source software, ranging from operating systems to databases, web servers, and e-commerce solutions; using open source software offers benefits such as security, flexibility, and auditability (of the program's source code). For individuals, participating in open source software projects can help to improve their

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Leveraging Data to Go SoLoMo: Yelp

If you're looking for a good restaurant, tailor, or pest control service in town, it is difficult to know which of the many options will provide the best service. luckily, there's Yelp. You've probably heard of Yelp-the review and rating platform where you can find valuable information on local businesses provided by previous customers. The company began in 2004 as a way for friends to exchange local service recommendations via email. The service quickly evolved to include social networking services and has expanded its operations to many countries around the world. Yelp has also been a pioneer in exploiting mobile technologies to develop location- and datadriven services. Boasting more than 100 million monthly mobile app visitors and more than 200 million reviews (as of 2019), Yelp tends to come up as an example whenever people talk about the intersection of social, local, and mobile services (sometimes called SoLoMo for short).

among the highest-rated restaurants within walking distance, book a table, and enjoy a great meal.

Yelp has embraced the rising trends in mobile usage by leveraging data and connections from local businesses to integrate messaging, transactions, quotes, waitlists, reservations, appointments, etc. Accordingly, Yelp's popularity and data density has given mobile operating systems good reason to integrate useful features into the software that powers our favorite phones. Part of the reason for Yelp's mobile success is the fact that a smartphone with a Yelp app installed is '  location-aware,' meaning that users can use the phone's global positioning system (gPS) capabilities to find Yelp reviews of locations in the area. This is very useful if you are in an unfamiliar area and would like to go eat somewhere with positive reviews. You can simply search for restaurants, choose from

Yelp has leveraged its dominating data presence and mobile software integration to its advantage. The company allows local businesses to advertise to local users, a technique that has proven quite powerful. If you open the Yelp app and are searching for restaurants, Yelp can be pretty confident that you're hungry and about to make a purchase. A cleverly placed ad offering a discount from a local pizza place may be just the thing that convinces you to buy a pizza instead of the Big Mac offered next door. Yelp is still seeing strong growth, with revenues of uS$250 million in the first quarter of 2020. However, Yelp does have some critics who feel that Yelp is manipulating reviews and blocking overly negative reviews to increase ad spending by businesses. Still, while smartphone users increasingly use their devices to find information about local business, Yelp is well positioned to continue its SoloMo leadership.

skill set or boost their CVs. For organizations, participating in open source projects can be a way to influence the direction the software's development may take and to build goodwill by giving back to the community.

Wikis Also based on the concept of collective intelligence, wikis are used for a variety of collaboration tasks. A wiki is a website allowing people to create, edit, or delete content as well as discuss about content or suggested changes with other members of the community. In contrast to a regular website, a wiki is linked to a database keeping a history of all prior versions and changes; thus, a wiki allows viewing prior versions of the pages as well as reverting any changes made to the content. The idea behind wikis is that by allowing anyone to contribute content or edit others' contributions, the collaborative work performed by the community helps minimize vandalism and ensure high-quality content (Figure 5.15). For example, Wikipedia articles are created by Wikipedia users, and almost any of these articles can be edited by either anonymous or registered users. By allowing easy access, Wikipedia has grown exponentially within just a few years. However, Wikipedia is not without critics. Some argue that, by allowing anyone to create and edit articles, systematic biases in the content can occur. This includes the ability for users to add misinformation that is hard to verify. For example, recent news shows that politicians, companies, and other entities of interest frequently edit their Wikipedia pages to portray a more positive image. Sometimes, so-called 'wiki wars' arise, where contributors continuously edit or delete each others' posts. Also, Wikipedia has been found to have a significant cultural bias on some topics, as most contributors are males from either North America or Europe, and the information is not always backed by verifiable sources. Given these issues, many universities discourage students from citing Wikipedia, and in some instances, professors have been failing students for using Wikipedia as their primary (or only) source. Still, the contributors' collective intelligence ensures that the quality of many articles matches (or surpasses) that of traditional encyclopedias, and a Wikipedia article may be a good starting point for researching about a topic; as always, it is good practice to evaluate the sources used within an article, and to consult other sources as well. Wikipedia openly acknowledges this situation and encourages users to check the facts against multiple sources.

Wikis have been used for many more things than just an online encyclopedia. The ability for users to contribute and edit content has a wide variety of applications, such as designing software, helping people find media, and even helping people play video games. In fact, many organizations are using wiki technology to create internal knowledge repositories.

HUMAN-BASED COMPUTING (CROWDSOURCING). Another way companies are using the collective intelligence of individuals is through crowdsourcing. When companies look for cheap labor, many immediately think about outsourcing work to companies in different countries, such as India, China, or Russia (see Chapter 1). However, companies have now found a way to use everyday people as a cheap labor force, a phenomenon called crowdsourcing .

Amazon took crowdsourcing mainstream with its micro-task marketplace called Mechanical Turk. Using this marketplace, requesters can crowdsource so-called human intelligence tasks (HITs), which are small, self-contained tasks that humans can solve easily but would be difficult for a computer to solve. Examples of HITs include tagging images, generating potential search

key words for a product, fixing product titles on e-commerce sites, and so on (Figure 5.16; see also Chapter 4 for more on consumer-to-business business models). Users can find HITs that are of interest to them, solve the tasks, and earn money that is credited to their Amazon account. As you can see, for companies, crowdsourcing is an innovative way to reduce costs by using the expertise of the crowds. Similar to grid computing (see Chapter 3), a person's 'idle time' is used for a certain business task, and many people are willing to provide their resources in exchange for a relatively small amount of money. To harness the power of the crowds, some companies have even created their own, internal, micro-task marketplaces; for example, Microsoft's 'Universal Human Relevance System' is used by Microsoft to crowdsource tasks related to improving Bing search results, conduct research, and so on. A related concept is that of open innovation. As discussed in Chapter 2, companies are increasingly attempting to create ad hoc research-and-development networks by integrating external stakeholders into their innovation processes to harness the power of the crowds.

## Enhancing Connection with Social Media

Social media applications also aid in connecting people with each other, companies with their customers  or  stakeholders,  or  people  with  content.  Without  a  doubt,  social  networking  has become the most popular type of application in this category; we explore social networking and other, lesser-known applications in the following sections.

SOCIAL NETWORKING. In addition to direct collaboration, social networking has become one of the most popular uses of the internet. Social networking sites create social online communities where individuals with a broad and diverse set of interests meet, communicate, and collaborate. Facebook exemplifies this trend, being the third most popular site in the U.S. (and being surpassed only by Google, YouTube, and Amazon), according to Alexa.com (2020). Facebook took the spot as the most frequented social network from Myspace.com, which originally was designed to be a social network based on musical interests but then changed to a general interest social network used primarily by teens and young adults; over time, the importance of Myspace has declined tremendously, and in May 2014, Myspace was barely ranked in the top 1,000 sites on the web. Because of the network effect, as Facebook grew, it became ever more attractive for other people to join. In April 2020, Facebook announced that it had 2.6 billion monthly active users, and it is still growing. Other social networks are built on the tremendous increase in mobile devices. For example, the location-based social network Swarm is built around the idea of people using their mobile devices to 'check in' at places.

Social networks were initially primarily popular among preteens, teens, and young adults, but social networking demographics have slowly shifted, with 79 percent of American internet users between 18 and 29 years and 46 percent of internet users over 64 years using Facebook. In addition to general interest social networks, several social online communities are targeted at professional audiences, allowing users to meet business contacts, post career profiles, present themselves in a professional context, ask for expert advice, or be contacted regarding job opportunities. For example, LinkedIn (owned by Microsoft) has more than 690 million members, and Xing (popular in the German-speaking market) has more than 15 million members. Further, enterprise-oriented social software such as IBM Connections features social networking tools that allow people within organizations to connect to one another; similarly, Yammer, part of

Microsoft, is designed as a private social network for communication and collaboration within organizations (Figure 5.17). Designed to mirror consumer-oriented social media apps people are used to, applications such as Yammer are but one example of increasing consumerization of IT, where technologies and applications are first designed for the consumer marketplace and then make inroads into organizational settings. Other players in the enterprise social networking market include Slack and Facebook's business-oriented social network named Facebook at Work.

Organizations also increasingly use social networks to connect with their customers. Numerous companies have their own Facebook pages to interact with their customers, get feedback on new products or services, or in general portray a positive brand image.

However, social networks are not without critics. In particular, one area of criticism is the way users' newsfeeds are assembled on social networks such as Facebook, where sophisticated algorithms analyze your (and others') behavior and try to predict which of your friends' posts may be of interest to you; for example, the algorithms analyze which posts you like, which friends you interact with most (e.g., as indicated by your activity in response to your friends' posts), how many comments or likes a post receives, and so on. Facebook's use of advanced analytics thus determines what type of items each user gets to see (or not). While this means that you might be more likely to see items you are actually interested in, this also results in people only being exposed to opinions of like-minded people, and some have accused Facebook of creating a 'filter bubble' (see Case 1 at the end of the chapter). Further, many companies are trying to use social media to attract web traffic; often, these companies post incomplete or tantalizing headlines for stories to encourage users to click on them. Such types of headlines are often referred to as clickbait ; as a user clicks on the link, the company earns revenue through ads posted on the page containing the article (which often turns out to be less than informative or useful; see also Case 2 at the end of the chapter).

Social Search As the web has grown explosively since its early days (in the first 6 years, the growth rate was 850 percent, and after only 15 years, the number of websites was larger than 100 million; Nielsen, 2006), finding relevant information has become increasingly difficult. Early search engines such as Altavista were based on key words embedded within pages and often tried to assemble 'directories' of the web. In 1996, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the founders of Google, came up with a new algorithm for internet search. Called BackRub, the algorithm used the number of other pages linking to a web page as a measure of interest, to return more relevant results to users. Yet returning the most relevant results to each individual user's query remains the holy grail for search engines. Given that people tend to trust recommendations from their networks of friends, search engines and social networks are trying to capitalize on the fact that content posted by friends is typically more relevant than content posted by complete strangers. Social search attempts to increase the relevance of search results by including content from social networks, blogs, or microblogging services. For example, some approaches let users annotate or tag search results, making it easier for others to find relevant information; this is

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## Anonymity, Trolling, and Cyberharassment

using pseudonyms, fictitious accounts, or proxy servers to hide one's online tracks, it is easy to operate anonymously on the internet. Often, there is a legitimate need for anonymity to allow individuals privacy protections, freedom from oppression, and other individual and societal benefits. unfortunately, all too frequently, the anonymity offered by the internet brings out the worst in people. When people are anonymous, they are more likely to enter into a state of deindividuation, a loss of self-awareness often causing antisocial behavior. deindividuation has been used to explain a lot of humanity's darkest behaviors, including violent crowds, lynch mobs, and even genocide.

industry and systematically harassed and doxed them by making their private details public. After a former boyfriend of one of the women wrote a lengthy disparaging blog post about her, others falsely accused her of entering into a relationship with a journalist in exchange for positive game reviews and ultimately threatened her with assault, rape, and murder. Most gamergate supporters were anonymous, making it difficult to identify or prosecute the harassers. The design of the internet makes it difficult to dramatically change a person's ability to be anonymous if they want to be, and the template for attack established by gamergate for cyberharassment continues even today.

While many people just want to lead civilized discussions in online forums, you are likely to have witnessed various vicious posts, nasty discussions, or outright fights in such forums. Many are waged by anonymous combatants who exhibit intolerance and anger toward others they view as being evil or wrong. These angry individuals are often referred to as trolls. More formally, an internet troll is a person who creates discord on the internet by starting arguments or upsetting people by posting inflammatory content on social media sites with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response, often for the troll's own amusement. Most of these trolls operate anonymously.

Much of the behavior of trolls can be classified as cyberharassment, which refers to the use of the internet to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. Cyberharassment can take many forms, from false accusations, defamation, slander, and libel to threats, vandalism, identity theft, and doxing (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual). Many feel that the internet has provided a platform for trolls to join together to become cyber lynch mobs.

## Questions

1. Reflecting on your past online behavior, do you think that the anonymity of the internet played a role in you engaging in antisocial behavior?
2. given the difficulty in prosecuting online trolls and those who engage in cyberharassment, what can society do to reduce these antisocial behaviors?

VIRAL MARKETING. In the offline world, marketing one's products or services is one of the most important aspects of successfully running a business. In an online context, marketing websites, products, and services is equally important, and business organizations use techniques such as search marketing, paid inclusion, and banner advertisements to promote their websites (see Chapter 4). Building on the foundations of social networking, advertisers are now using viral marketing to promote their websites, products, or services. Viral marketing is using the network effect to increase brand awareness. The term viral marketing was coined by Harvard business professor Jeffrey Rayport to describe how good marketing techniques can be driven by word-of-mouth or person-to-person communication, similar to how real viruses are transmitted

through offline social networks. Rather than creating traditional banner ads or sending out millions of emails, businesses create advertisements in a way that entices the viewers to share the messages with their friends through email or social networks so that the messages will spread like a virus. Viral marketing can take many forms, such as video clips, e-books, flash games, and even text messages.

The power of viral marketing can be a great tool, and there are several techniques that are critical to creating a successful viral marketing campaign. Writer and interaction designer Thomas Baekdal (2006) has outlined some critical factors in viral marketing, including the following:

- ■ Do something unexpected
- ■ Make people feel something
- ■ Make sequels
- ■ Allow sharing and easy distribution
- ■ Never restrict access to the viral content

Following these principles entices users to view content, share it with their friends, and revisit the site to look for new content. For example, Turkish Airlines's 'Kobe vs. Messi Selfie Shootout' video quickly went viral. Likewise, Volvo Trucks's 'Epic Split' video featuring JeanClaude van Damme became one of the most successful viral videos (and triggered numerous user-generated parodies).

One of the earliest viral marketing campaigns was used during the launch of the free Hotmail email service. One of the techniques used was adding a footer to every outbound message. This footer gave a short message about Hotmail.com's free email service, and the message about the service was spread with every email sent through the service. This campaign proved very effective (Hotmail spent only US$500,000 to get 12 million subscribers), and Microsoft later bought Hotmail.

With people increasingly posting pictures or videos of things they like or enjoy, such posts can go viral as well. Thus, another viral marketing strategy is to do good or innovative things that people take pictures of and share and to rely on people's social networks to spread the message.

## Managing Social Media Applications in the Enterprise

As you have seen, mobile social, the cloud, and Big Data have enabled various tools that organizations can use for communicating with external stakeholders as well as for enhancing collaboration and connection of employees within the enterprise. In the following sections, we discuss factors organizations should take into account when considering the use of social media applications within the organization. Then, we highlight potential pitfalls brought about by these tools when used by people within and outside an organization.

## Organizational Issues

In previous discussions, you have learned that, in many cases, technology can be an important enabler of strategic advantage if implemented and managed carefully. Similarly, with internal enterprise-oriented social media applications, the technology is a critical success factor, but it is not the only component, and change management can be critical for success or failure of such initiatives. Just providing the tools in the hope that employees will use them for the intended purpose is not enough; rather, management must ensure that employees are aware of the tools, their purpose, and rules or policies surrounding the use of these tools. Given that social media applications are based on close social interaction, information sharing, and network effects, corporate culture is key to successful implementations of social media applications in the organization. Specifically, a corporate culture of knowledge sharing, trust, and honest feedback is conducive to such implementations. In addition to culture, various other caveats must be taken into consideration (Khan, 2008) (Figure 5.18).

ENTERPRISE≠WEB. While reading this chapter, you have learned about many web-based technologies you are familiar with from your daily life. Although many of those technologies are hugely successful in a consumer environment, this success does not always translate to success

<!-- image -->

in a corporate environment. On the web, sites such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and Facebook have evolved over the years to become as successful as they are today, and examples such as Myspace show that success at one point in time is not guaranteed to continue. Further, what appears as seamless 'magic' collaboration is sometimes based on intricate processes. For example, good articles in Wikipedia are based not only on the contributions of many editors but also on many behind-the-scenes discussions over controversial issues or over how to improve an article. In contrast, many open source software projects closely guard changes to the software's programming code such that only a limited number of 'committers' can implement suggested changes.

CULTURE. As highlighted earlier, organizational culture is a critical success factor for implementing social media applications in organizations, and many proposed projects face strong cultural resistance. Social media applications, based on the premise of open communication, do not always do well within traditional top-down organizational structures based on rigid hierarchies and control. Further, social media applications base their success on user-driven self-expression (if no one were willing to update his or her status on Facebook, people would eventually stop visiting the site); on the web, people participate by choice, but people in organizations cannot be forced to participate. Hence, organizations must understand the multiple stakeholders, personalities, and perspectives of future users and ensure that any enterprise-oriented social media initiative will appeal to the organization's members.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT. Any implementation of social media applications should be driven by a specific usage context. Just as users choose popular social media applications such as YouTube or Wikipedia to fulfill a need, the work-related context should drive the choice of tools. In other words, organizations should always ask what objective is to be accomplished with the tool and only then decide which type of tool to implement. Merely setting up a wiki site and hoping that the employees will use it for the 'right' purpose most likely will not lead to the intended results.

ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHIES. Often, enterprise-oriented social media initiatives are driven by user departments, and small-scale pilot implementations appear to work quite well. However, organization-wide implementations typically need changes in terms of organizational culture and processes and often the flattening of organizational hierarchies. Therefore, to be successful, enterprise-oriented social media implementations need the support and active involvement of senior management to cope with the large magnitude of changes.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## Crowdfunding Failures

Crowdfunding refers to the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of investors, typically via the internet. Crowdfunding is an innovative way to get financing to support projects that might not otherwise be fundable using traditional methods. Another advantage of crowdfunding is that it connects investors with similar interests that might otherwise not have been able to come together, and projects can leverage the power of social media and viral marketing to gain project backers. unfortunately, as with many other technological advances, crowdfunding can also be abused by unscrupulous individuals looking to take advantage of unsophisticated investors. There are several ways that crowd funded projects can fall short of expectations.

Some projects simply overpromise and under-deliver. The campaigners may simply not have the experience needed to execute  the  project  or  may  have  underestimated  the resources and effort required. The Coolest Cooler, for example, initially launched back in 2014 and collected more than uS$13 million on the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The Coolest Cooler, a multi-function ice chest, was backed by 60,000 people and is still the second highest grossing crowdfunded project on Kickstarter. As of late 2019, only 20,000 coolers had shipped to customers and the company has since shuttered. After years of delays, the company blamed increasing overseas tariffs for their manufacturing delays, but the truth is the company just over-promised and underdelivered on expectations.

pledges on Kickstarter before Kickstarter pulled the plug. Skarp was unable to demonstrate that it had even a prototype of the product. Skarp relaunched the project on Indiegogo (another crowdfunding site) and collected an additional uS$507,000. As of June 2019, the company is still struggling to deliver a prototype, with an estimated 2021 ship date.

Other projects like the iBackPack are outright scams. The owner of iBackPack, which is under state and federal investigation, raised uS$800,000 yet did not deliver on his crowdfunded promises. Instead, he claims he was a victim of circumstance and bad luck; however his past business failures would suggest otherwise. lastly, some projects are simply pranks or jokes. A user set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund his board game-playing habit, and another asked for a million dollars to build a custom car.

The moral of the story is that crowdfunding sites are not stores. It's important to understand that you are contributing to a promise and promises can be broken.

NETWORK EFFECTS AND CRITICAL MASS. Successful social media applications such as Wikipedia base their success on network effects and the long tail   (see   Chapter   4  )   and have needed some time to achieve a critical mass. For example, although Wikipedia enjoys millions of page views per day, there is only a small number of people who choose to actively participate in the creation of content. Within organizations, achieving the critical mass needed for successful social media implementations is often difficult and takes considerable time and patience. Although for many smaller organizations collaborative social media applications can be beneficial, they will most likely not be able to harness the network effects that can be achieved with a larger user base.

GENERATION GAP. The success of an enterprise-oriented social media initiative is also heavily dependent on the composition of the organization's workforce. In organizations with large numbers of millennials, who have grown accustomed to highly interactive and communicative online social environments, such initiatives have a higher likelihood of success; in contrast, many baby boomers are used to rigid hierarchies and organizational structures and are less likely to fully embrace the capabilities of organizational social media applications. Further, senior organizational members may not fully grasp the potential and implications of social media applications in organizational settings.

TECHNOLOGICAL INERTIA. One factor hindering the adoption of many new technologies is technological inertia. In many cases, people are not willing to switch to new applications unless they see real, tangible benefits. This can be especially a hindrance with social media applications, many of which incorporate a variety of other tools (such as chat or instant messaging interfaces within social networking sites).

TECHNOLOGICAL INTEGRATION. Organizations will have to ensure that any enterprise-oriented social media applications are integrated well with the organization's existing information systems infrastructure to reap the greatest benefits from connecting people with one another and connecting people with information. Typically, organizations choose systems provided by outside vendors such as Yammer, which allows the organization to create its own private social network. However, organizational users will use the tools they are used to as a benchmark, and many consumer-oriented tools such as Facebook create high expectations of usability for any internal tool.

SECURITY. A final issue is related to security and intellectual property. For organizations, securing their information systems infrastructure is of paramount concern (see Chapter 10). Any application that allows closer collaboration by increasing data sharing will necessarily incur greater risks of security breaches. Companies thus must balance their desire for enhancing collaboration with the need to protect intellectual property and compliance with rules and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

## Downsides and Dangers of Using Social Media Applications

Many organizations (and individuals) have learned painful lessons from public relations blunders and from not considering the fundamental rule: The internet never forgets. Another fundamental rule brought about by social media applications is to constantly monitor social media and quickly and appropriately react to emerging issues. In this section, we highlight potential pitfalls of social media and the enterprise.

ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS. Online as well as offline consumers increasingly consult the web before making a purchase decision. Before making a purchase on Amazon, many potential buyers first consult the user reviews; relatedly, people read other travelers' reviews of hotels or restaurants on Tripadvisor or consult websites dedicated to providing expert reviews. Unfortunately, such reviews are not always as unbiased as they seem, and sometimes companies hire people to deliberately spread positive (or negative) word of mouth across a variety of sites. The act of posting fake product reviews is unethical, to say the least. Fakespot.com, a website analyzing user reviews on Amazon using text mining (see Chapter 6), lists various products having more than 80 percent fake reviews. Whereas Amazon started suing companies that offer good (read: fake) reviews for a fee and sellers who offered items for sale on Amazon's sites and who purchased fake reviews, the company has not managed to end this practice, and fake reviews are likely to continue to spread, undermining trust in review systems and leading customers to make suboptimal purchasing decisions.

MICROBLOGGING. Microblogging can be very valuable for corporate communications, but it is not without controversy and must be used carefully. For example, in early 2014, New York City's police department (NYPD), attempting to boost the department's image, encouraged people to tweet images with police officers using the hashtag #myNYPD. Unfortunately, the response was not what the NYPD had hoped for. Rather than tweeting positive photos, the department's critics soon used the hashtag for pictures depicting police brutality and racial discrimination.

For individuals, posting the wrong 'tweets' can also have serious consequences, as they are more likely than not to reach the wrong readers-sooner or later. A Chicago woman was recently sued by her landlord for posting a tweet complaining about the management company's reaction to mold in her apartment. The management company sued her for defamation, arguing that the tweet was published on a global scale. Whereas the lady had a mere 22 followers on Twitter, the landlord's lawsuit was covered in major news outlets, online and offline, including the Chicago Tribune , the Associated Press, and the New York Times .

SOCIAL NETWORKS. While free to host, having and maintaining a page on a social network is not free for organizations-the company should take great care to monitor what is happening on the page and take appropriate action. For example, Starbucks lets its customers upload

their favorite Starbucks-related pictures to its Facebook page. However, people frequently post unrelated pictures, play pranks with the company logo, or post otherwise inappropriate content. A company then has to walk the fine line of removing inappropriate content to preserve the company's image while not alienating its fans. Starbucks chooses to liberally allow unrelated content.

As with most social software, posting the 'wrong' content can quickly get you in trouble. Companies routinely check social networking sites before making hiring decisions, and many applicants have lost a job offer they almost had secured. Similarly, your posts may make it farther than you think; stories abound of people getting laid off after ranting about their jobs and their bosses in Facebook status updates-unfortunately, the boss was in the employee's contacts list and could immediately see the post. Further, many people never bother to adjust their accounts' privacy settings and inadvertently shout things out for the whole world to read.

BAD VIBES GOING VIRAL. As with other social media, viral marketing can be a blessing or a nightmare. One of the most infamous examples happened back in 2008, when a musician on a tour witnessed from his airplane window how baggage handlers mishandled-and broke-his US$3,500 guitar. After not getting a satisfying response from the airline, the musician decided to write a song and post it on YouTube in 2009. The video quickly went viral, and the airline rushed to 'make things right' for the musician. For the airline, however, the damage was done, and the video has since attracted more than 15 million views. Likewise, a Ryanair passenger's complaint letter posted on Facebook was shared more than 68,000 times in less than 10 days. Whereas traditional phone complaints were a one-to-one conversation between the customer and a call center agent, the balance of power has shifted toward the customer, necessitating swift, effective responses by the companies. A case in point is the response of Domino's Pizza, where two employees posted videos on YouTube displaying them playing not-so-harmless pranks and preparing sandwiches with disgusting ingredients; the videos quickly went viral and attracted more than a million viewers in just a few days. Domino's was initially slow in responding and decided not to respond to the crisis, fearing that a reaction might draw even more interest. After 48 hours, however, Domino's changed its strategy, opened a Twitter account to interact with concerned customers, and posted a video response by the president of Domino's on YouTube assuring that the culprits had been found, that the entire store had been closed and sanitized, and that everything would be done to avoid hiring the 'wrong' people in the future. A nationwide survey by a media research company has found the response to be fairly successful, with more than 90 percent of the respondents indicating that the response video was effective in restoring trust in the brand.

LESSONS LEARNED. As you probably know from your own experience and have seen from these stories, news travels fast in social media. For the companies in question, this is an enormous threat, as negative publicity can quickly reach millions of people. At the same time, the company's reaction is equally critical, as it can reach people just as fast and thus must be carefully crafted. Richard Levick, president of Levick Strategic Communications, has provided some tips on how to prepare for and deal with such crises:

1. Identify a crisis team including members from within your organization (e.g., public relations or executive team) and from the outside (e.g., lawyers).
2. Identify your worst social media nightmare (and make sure to know the signs to look for, such as search engine key terms your opposition could use).
3. Monitor your social media environment (such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter) and be connected and responsive.
4. Act fast. The first 24 hours count.

As in the offline world, companies should try to avoid such crises in the first place, but being prepared for a public relations disaster is crucial in today's fast-paced world. Many organizations have realized the need for social media monitoring; for example, Dell recently opened its 'Social Media Listening Command Center' as a key part of its overall marketing efforts. Monitoring social media posts mentioning Dell in about a dozen languages not only enables Dell to respond to customers' problems before they go viral but also serves as an effective means to gather business intelligence. We will discuss more about the role of social media monitoring and business intelligence in Chapter 8.

SOCIETAL IMPACTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA. Clearly, social media have greatly changed the way we interact and will continue to do so. Over the past decade and a half (Myspace, the once widely popular social network, was launched in 2003), people's attitudes toward sharing content as well as toward privacy have seen a tremendous shift. Likewise, social media have provided people with far wider access to information and have democratized content creation, which has tremendous effects on the way societies function. For example, whereas U.S. presidential campaigns used to be largely funded by big donors, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign made wide use of social media and generated significant funding from small contributors. Similarly, Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential nomination campaign relied on a large crowd of small donors for support. In addition, the internet and social media has lowered barriers to entry by giving candidates free platforms to make their voices heard by removing the costs for printing and distributing campaign material. Together, this has lowered the influence of the wealthy on politics.

Yet people also point to downsides brought about by everyone's ability to create content and by the way this content is being spread. In particular, traditional media outlets used editorial judgment to decide what would be covered. In social media, this judgment is increasingly replaced by automated algorithms that determine what content is being shown to social media users. For example, as algorithms on social networks analyze user behavior to provide the most relevant content, there is the risk of algorithms filtering out content that is in conflict with the users' viewpoints. Whether these developments are potentially hurting democracy remains to be seen, but it is clear that social media and the accompanying societal changes will continue to have large impacts on individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Social Travel Platforms

Spring break is coming, and you've decided to go to Puerto Vallarta this year. Chances are that your first step will be to check the websites of Expedia, Priceline, Travelocity, and Orbitz for flights to and hotels in your chosen destination. We all know the big four online travel agencies; in today's digital world, they dominate the travel industry. They took the old brick-and-mortar travel industry and turned it into an online service where you can click to book flights and hotel reservations, change or cancel flights, reserve rental cars-even plan a vacation. In internet terms, you can think of the big four as still being in Online Travel 1.0. But technology marches relentlessly on, and Online Travel 2.0 is in the works. Evidence of this transition to Online Travel 2.0 is reflected in Expedia recently purchasing both Travelocity and Orbitz. When competition heats up, mergers and acquisitions often follow.

A new crop of travel sites has popped up, offering several benefits over the big online travel agencies. These travel sites are very different from typical online travel services, however. The first, and arguably the most prominent, example is Airbnb. Airbnb allows people to offer houses, condos, apartments, and rooms (private or shared) to anyone who happens to be traveling through the area. If you're planning a vacation, you could book a hotel through the hotel's website or an online travel agency. Alternatively, you could use Airbnb to rent a house or apartment from someone, often for a fraction of the cost. Property owners benefit by generating income from unused living space, and Airbnb handles the processing of all rent payments. The site also offers an extensive rating and review platform that motivates property owners to provide excellent service to attract future renters

(on the other hand, Airbnb has been repeatedly criticized for commercial landlords putting a strain on local housing markets). Airbnb has been extremely successful so far, with more than two million people staying in an Airbnb each night by October 2019. If renting a house from a stranger worries you, there will always be hotels for you to use. But if you trust the ratings and experiences from 'the crowd,' you can save a bundle in many popular locations to which you might travel.

Once you get to your location, however, you'll need a way to get around. Again, you could book a rental car through a car rental company or an online travel agency. Or you could save some more cash and use a service like uber. This service provides a platform through which individuals can request and pay for a 'taxi' service from qualified drivers in 785 cities in 63 countries (as of mid-2020). using the uber mobile app, riders can request a ride at the tap of a button and then monitor the location of the reserved car in real time. upon completion of the trip, the uber app allows the driver to collect payment. uber requires that drivers submit to an insurance and background check and has typically targeted a higher-end market of users. The first uber drivers had such cars as Cadillac Escalades, BMW 7 Series, and   Mercedes-Benz S550 sedans. The company has since expanded to a wider selection of cars to appeal to more riders and has recently implemented a ride-sharing system that allows riders to quickly request to 'ride along' with someone to a specific destination. Similar to Airbnb, uber encourages the use of a rating and review system to incentivize drivers to provide excellent service.

So next time you go on a trip, consider the benefits available through these social travel platforms. You might save a few bucks and maybe even make a friend in the process.

## Key Points Review

1. Explain organizations' needs for communication and collaboration. In today's increasingly competitive world, organizations need to communicate and collaborate effectively and efficiently within and outside organizational boundaries. For example, virtual teams, composed of team members located around the globe that are forming and disbanding as needed, have communication needs that often cannot be met by traditional communication media. Likewise, working from home has become the norm, rather than exception, for many organizations. Organizations use tools such as collaboration software, videoconferencing or intranets for their communication and collaboration needs.
2. Explain social media and evolving web capabilities. In contrast to traditional Web 1.0 sites, Web 2.0 applications allow people to collaborate and share information online, with a shift in the users' role from passive consumer of content to creator of usergenerated content. Owing to societal changes, using social media can be an important factor in being able to attract or retain employees as younger generations are joining the workforce. Future web capabilities extending Web 2.0 are the semantic web and the 'contextual web,' which is characterized by devices providing the information and content needed depending on the user's specific context. To harness the opportunities brought about by these changes, organizations are increasingly using social software to connect with customers and internal or external stakeholders to become more innovative or productive.
3. Describe various social media applications, and explain their role in enhancing communication, collaboration, cooperation, and connection. Social software can enhance communication within organizations as well as between an organization and its stakeholders. Blogs, microblogging, and instant messaging are widely used by individuals and organizations to communicate with internal and

external stakeholders. Social media applications such as media sharing, social bookmarking, or social cataloging applications facilitate cooperation by using the network effect to provide the greatest benefit to users. Further, social media applications have enabled new forms of collaboration for organizations and individuals. These and other technologies have enabled cloud-based collaboration tools, content management systems, and wikis as well as the use of collective intelligence and crowdsourcing. Finally, social media applications aid in connecting people with each other. For individuals, social networking has become an important way to meet new friends, connect with family members, or meet new colleagues and business partners. The reach of social networks is also used by business organizations to market their products or services through viral marketing, which resembles offline word-of-mouth communication, in which advertising messages are spread like viruses through social networks.

Describe how companies can manage enterprise- oriented social media applications and deal with

potential pitfalls associated with social media.

- Organizations must take into account that success in a consumer environment does not necessarily translate into success in a corporate environment. Further, organizations must take into account issues associated with culture, organizational context, and organizational hierarchies; in addition, lack of critical mass, the generation gap, and technological inertia can hinder the success of enterprise-oriented social media initiatives. Finally, in organizational contexts, integration with existing technologies and security are of primary concern. Further, an organization's opponents can use social media to spread damaging content or information to people all over the world within a very short time. Organizations should therefore carefully prepare for such incidents.

## Net Stats: Most Popular Twitter Accounts

Twitter  has  become  an  important  communication  tool  for many organizations and individuals. As of October 2021, Twitter had about 463 million active users and this is projected to grow in the coming years. The social media platform enables organizations  to  quickly  send  messages  (tweets)  in  the  form of text, video, picture, or a combination of these to their followers and the world. These messages may appear on the timeline of accounts that follow the organizations (or other similar accounts)  through  retweets,  likes,  and/or  comments.  In  cases where lots of accounts tweet about a keyword and/or hashtag, it may trend and go viral, leading to a wider reach. Aside from these, the platform also enables organizations to advertise and sure Campus Travel tracks the prices of packages and services that its closest competitor offers.

To do so, a database must be created to track this information. Follow these steps to create the database:

- ■ Create a database called 'tracking.'
- ■ Create a table called 'company\_info.' In this table, create fields for company\_name and company\_URL.
- ■ Create a table called 'products.' In this table, create fields for the company\_name, product\_ name, product\_description, product\_price, and date\_retrieved.
- ■ Create a table called 'services.' In this table, create fields for company\_name, service\_name, service description, service\_price, and date\_retrieved.
- ■ Once these tables are created, go to the relationship view (select 'Relationships' under the 'Database Tools' tab) and connect the company\_info (one side) and products (many side) tables and the company\_info (one side) and service (many side) tables.
- ■ Make sure that when you create the relationships, the referential integrity option is selected. (This will make sure that when you delete a company, the products associated with the company are also deleted.)
- ■ Test the referential integrity by adding data to the tables and make sure that when a company is deleted in the company table, the products table is updated, too.

promote  their  brands.  Twitter  enables  customers  to  contact organizations via direct messages, tags, and hashtags. For many young people, contacting organizations via social media platforms like Twitter is considered the most convenient channel instead  of  via  email  or  phone. This  means  that  organizations without social media presence may lose out.

## CASE 1 Living in a Social Media Filter Bubble

Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become integral to how we interact with the world around us. From posting about what we had for lunch to our political views to our favorite movies, TV shows, and products, we express ourselves digitally in these online forums. With so many people posting so much information, it can be challenging to keep up with everything that is going on in our circle of friends and acquaintances. To make things easier and help us better manage the volume of posts, social media platforms have introduced algorithmic prioritization of posts. These algorithms study what you are most interested in, whom you have close relationships with, even where you are located to determine which of the posts in your feed are most likely to interest you. In most cases, this is a good thing-the posts in your feed are the most relevant to your interests. A problem arises, however, when we consider the impact of social media on the shifting landscape of political thought and diversity of expression.

led to improvements in editorial standards and laws restricting consolidation in the industry.

For many years, professional journalists have been challenged by the ease at which virtually 'anyone' can publish information on social media. Historically, traditional newspaper companies controlled the physical distribution of sheets of paper. Content was generated by newspaper employees, edited, and then distributed. Print newspapers during this period were the primary mechanism by which not just news but editorial and political opinions were shared across society.  The  system  certainly  wasn't perfect-political expression on a mass scale was concentrated in the hands of a few major publishers. Regulations were required, and social norms had to evolve to address the threats this concentration of control posed. Yellow journalism scares in the early 1900s

Fast-forward to today and digital media has drastically changed the publishing landscape. It is no longer necessary to invest heavily in a printing and distribution system to reach a mass audience, and many traditional print newspapers have disappeared. This shift has taken a great deal of power out of the hands of traditional publishers and left the market for news and content wide open. As a result, we are left with a new set of challenges on how political thought and opinions are disseminated throughout society. The old regulations and social norms may no longer be adequate to mitigate the threats posed by dysfunctional distribution systems. Stepping into this wide-open market for news and content distribution are platform providers like Google, Apple, Facebook, and others. These platform providers have traditionally thought of themselves as technological enablers, agnostic to the political whims of the public they serve. The reality is that the content posted and consumed by the public on these new media platforms has become the de facto political discourse of our day.

Enter the algorithmic newsfeed. The algorithms are designed to show us things we will like and the things we want to read. It is possible that most of this content is benign, such as the latest gossip on celebrities or a new fashion trend; however, a good deal has to do with news and political issues of the day. Indeed, many people now get their news primarily from social media. In an election year, our feeds are choked with news and opinions about this candidate or that. When the algorithms start to sift through this tidal wave of information, they do what they are designed to do-pick out  things  that  we  will  like.  Opposing views  or  dissenting  opinions  are suppressed-not through active censorship but simply by being less preferred by the viewer.  Because  we  choose  our  social media friends and interests, we are then essentially living in an information bubble. We only see content we like, news is presented from a perspective aligned with our own, and opinions that agree with our own. This filtering and silent censorship of our worldviews can have profound effects. We may come to believe that everyone shares our views and opinions because that is what we see in our newsfeeds-a self-reinforcing collection of stories and content known as a filter bubble or echo chamber. We are surprised to encounter others with views different from our own and in some cases react angrily by removing ('unfriending') the offending individual from our network. This can amplify divisions between groups and can ratchet up tensions in political discourse by making it far less likely that we are aware of and even understand opposing views, let alone empathize with those who hold them.

Technology is always evolving, and our society both reacts to and drives technological change. When new content distribution platforms take over the mechanisms of social discourse, many of our assumptions about the nature of politics and the nature of political debate can be undermined. How these new mechanisms and social interactions will shape up in the long run is an open question. The only certainty is that change is inevitable and only diligence will allow us to maintain  the  free  and  open  society  we  have enjoyed for so long. Conscious effort will be required to amplify the benefits and mitigate the risks of a changing technological and social landscape.

## Questions

- 5-44. Have you personally experienced the information filter bubble effect? How would you know if you did? What was the topic?
- 5-45. How might the information filter bubble effect be overcome? What technological and social changes might be needed to mitigate algorithmic self-reinforcement? Would those changes drive users towards or away from a social media platform?

5-46. What role should platform providers play in social discourse? Do these technology companies have an obligation to understand the impacts they are having on society? Do they have a responsibility to participate?

## CASE 2 Like Farming and Clickbait

Facebook uses algorithms to select what content goes in your newsfeed. These algorithms take a variety of things into account, such as your relationship to the poster, your interests, and even your location. However, one of the most important factors is the popularity of the content, which is driven by the number of likes or shares that a post has received. If a post has been liked or shared by many people, it will be more likely to show  up  in  other  people's  feeds.  The assumption here is that because lots of people are liking or sharing the post, it must contain broadly appealing or desirable content. Usually, this is a good thing-it can help you quickly get to content that your friends and family have already vetted and that you are likely to enjoy and want to see. Unfortunately, scammers have developed a variety of mechanisms to take advantage of this functionality.

artificially inflate the popularity of their posts. One mechanism is so-called 'like farming.'

Scammers take advantage of their victims by getting them to view content related to their scams or to download viruses or other malware. Just like spam email, it only requires a very small percentage of recipients to click on a malicious link or to run a malicious attachment for the scammer to make money. As a result, scammers have an incentive to get as many people as possible to view their content or click their links. To accomplish this on a social media platform, scammers look for ways to get lots of people to view their content by having it show up in their newsfeed. Because a post's popularity can drive how frequently it shows up in people's  feeds,  scammers look for ways to

Like farming begins when a scammer posts an article or story that is seemingly innocuous and designed to get people to like or share it. Often, these posts appeal to the emotions or political views of the readers. 'This poor little girl with cancer lost her hair to chemotherapy-'like' this post to let her know she's still beautiful!' or 'This new government policy is outrageous-'like' this post  if  you're  outraged,  too!'  Another approach is to try to convince readers that they can win a valuable prize-such as the latest smartphone or even plain old cash-by liking the story. Any story offering to enter you in a contest or give you something for simply liking or sharing is highly suspicious and unlikely to be legitimate. Stories promising that 'If I get X number of likes, then something amazing will happen for me' or 'I was challenged to get X number of likes' are also highly likely to be like-farming schemes.

Once  the  scammer  has  convinced enough people to like or share the story, the scammer changes out the content. The post is edited such that it no longer contains the emotional story,  puzzle,  or  contest  but instead shows marketing material for the scam or other undesirable content. In some cases, the scammer will sell the rights to edit the post to other scammers on a black market. A post with a high popularity rating that can be edited at will is a valuable commodity to those looking to do you harm. Either way,

you and your friends are now seeing questionable and even dangerous content thanks to the farmed likes.

Other, less malicious forms of abuse take advantage of the algorithmic post selection as well. Many organizations will create headlines for their stories that are incomplete or tantalizing to encourage users to click on them, like 'You won't believe what happens next.' These 'clickbait' headlines force users to actually click on the story to learn a key detail or to find out the answer to a question. When the story gets clicked on, the social media platform counts that as a vote toward the popularity of the story. The user has unwittingly bumped up the popularity of the post and made it more likely that it will be seen by members of the network. This increases the popularity rating of the post or the poster and makes it more likely that the content will be seen by more people. This type of abuse isn't necessarily perpetrated by actual scammers, just organizations looking to improve their online popularity ratings and the effectiveness of their advertising and marketing material. However, scammers often use these techniques as well. Falling for clickbait can lead you to malware and other scam sites.

How can one avoid falling victim to like farming and clickbait? It starts with being better informed. Look at the source of a post. Is it a reputable news organization or an unknown site? User behavior is also an important factor. Avoid liking or sharing suspicious posts and stories. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Most social network platforms, including Facebook, provide tools that allow users to review their activity log and see what they have liked or shared. Users can take advantage of these tools to look back at their history and identify content that has changed or that they now recognize as like-farming or clickbait material. By reporting or un-liking suspicious content, this type of abuse can be mitigated. In mid-2019, Facebook announced updates to algorithm to reduce the amount of clickbait in users' newsfeeds. The new algorithm identifies headlines that are exaggerated or withhold information by focusing on
