## Strengthening Business-toBusiness Relationships via Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management

Preview

This chapter extends the prior discussion regarding how companies  are  deploying  enterprise-wide  information systems to build and strengthen organizational partnerships. Enterprise systems help integrate various business activities, streamline and better manage interactions with customers, and better coordinate with suppliers in order to  meet  changing  customer  demands  more  efficiently and effectively. In this chapter, two additional powerful systems are introduced: supply chain management (SCM) systems  supporting  business-to-business  (B2B)  transactions  and  customer  relationship  management  (CRM) systems for promoting and selling products and building and nourishing long-term customer relationships. When added to enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, both of these systems tie the customer to the supply chain that includes the manufacturer and suppliers all the way back to the raw materials that ultimately become the product no matter where in the world they originate.

More  and  more  companies  find  that  they  need systems  that  span  their  entire organization  to  tie everything  together.  As  a  result,  an  understanding  of supply  chain  management  and  customer  relationship management is critical to succeed in today's   competitive and ever-changing digital world.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Walmart

A s the world's largest retailer, Walmart is known for its relentless pursuit of lowering costs and passing those savings on to shoppers to undercut competitors' prices. Much of the company's success has been widely attributed to its effective use of technology to support its supply chain. Through a combination of distribution practices, truck fleet management, and technological innovations, Walmart became a model of supply chain efficiency. Being the largest retailer and private-sector employer in the world, Walmart employs more than 2.2 million people worldwide (1.5 million in the United States) and, in 2020, had about 11,500 stores in 31 countries.

One of  Walmart's  famous  supply  chain  innovations  is vendor-managed inventory, where manufacturers are responsible for monitoring inventory levels of their products in  Walmart's warehouses, helping Walmart achieve close to 100 percent order fulfillment on merchandise and essentially eliminating the loss of sales due to out-of-stock items. Walmart further streamlined its supply chain by creating communication networks with suppliers to improve product  flow  and  reduce  inventories.  The  network  of  global suppliers, warehouses, and retail stores has been described as behaving almost like a single firm. Walmart also developed the concept of 'cross docking'-direct transfers from inbound to outbound truck trailers without extra storage (see Figure 8.1). The company's trucks continuously deliver goods to distribution, where they are stored, repackaged, and distributed without sitting in inventory.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Describe supply chain management systems and how they help to improve businessto-business processes.
2.  Describe customer relationship management systems and how they help to improve the activities involved in promoting and selling products to customers as well as providing customer service and nourishing long-term relationships.

Walmart's  investments  in  technology  to  support  its supply chain have also resulted in powerful customer relationship management capabilities. Walmart's information systems record every purchase in every store around the world, along with a host of other information (location, time of day, other items purchased in the same order, etc.). Its data warehouse containing all these data is one of the largest in the world. As a result, Walmart can stock more of the most popular products and cluster items that people tend to buy at the same time. As Walmart's online business continues to grow, it is carefully refining its supply chain to optimize both traditional and online sales. These and other innovations have fueled and maintained Walmart's impressive growth and market share. Walmart continued  to  be  the  largest  U.S.  retailer  (Amazon  is second place),  having  e-commerce sales  of  over  US$28 billion and global sales of over US$510 billion in 2019.

Information systems are increasingly central to streamlining supply chains, coordinating with suppliers and  distributors,  and  managing  and  leveraging  relationships with customers. With increasing geopolitical risk and looming threats of decoupling of major economies,  being  able  to  effectively  manage  supply  chains is essential for organizations Those organizations that develop advanced systems capabilities in these crucial areas of business will, like Walmart, gain a significant edge over competitors in the market.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

## Supply Chain Management

In the previous chapter, we discussed the need to share internal data in order to streamline business processes, improving coordination within the organization to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Let's now turn our attention to collaborating with partners along the supply chain. Obtaining the raw materials and components that a company uses in its daily operations is an important key to business success. When deliveries from suppliers are accurate and timely, companies can convert them to finished products more efficiently. Coordinating this effort with suppliers has become a central part of many companies' overall business strategy, as it can help them reduce costs associated with inventory levels and get new products to market more quickly. Ultimately, this  helps  companies drive profitability and improve their customer service because they can react to changing market conditions swiftly. Collaborating or sharing information with suppliers has become a strategic necessity for business success. In other words, by developing and maintaining stronger, more integrated relationships with suppliers, companies can more effectively compete in their markets through cost reductions and responsiveness to market demands.

## What Is a Supply Chain?

The term supply chain is commonly used to refer to a collection of companies and processes involved in everything from extracting raw materials to moving a product from the suppliers of raw materials to the suppliers of intermediate components, then to final production, and, ultimately, to the customer. Companies often procure specific raw materials and components from many different  'upstream'  suppliers. These  suppliers,  in  turn,  work  with  their  own suppliers to obtain raw materials and components; their suppliers work with additional suppliers, and so forth. The further out in the supply chain one looks, the more suppliers are involved. As a result, the term 'chain' becomes somewhat of a misnomer since it implies one-to-one relationships facilitating a chain of events flowing from the first supplier to the second to the third and so on. Similarly, on the 'downstream' side, the products move to many different customers. The flow of materials from suppliers to customers can thus be more accurately described as a supply network because of the various interrelated parties involved in moving raw materials, intermediate components, and, finally, the end product within the production process (Figure 8.2).

Most companies are depending on a steady source of key supplies to produce their goods or services. For example, luxury restaurants require their produce to be consistently of high quality; similarly, car manufacturers need steel, paint, or electronic components in the right quantities, at the right quality and price, and at the right time. Thus, most companies are seeking long-term B2B relationships with a limited number of carefully selected suppliers-rather than one-time deals-and invest considerable efforts in selecting their suppliers or business partners; often, suppliers are assessed not only on product features such as price or quality but also on suppliers' characteristics, such as trustworthiness, commitment, or viability.

## Business-to-Business Electronic Commerce: Exchanging Data in Supply Networks

Transactions  conducted  electronically  between  different  businesses  in  a  supply  network,  not involving the end consumer, are referred to as business-to-business electronic commerce (EC). This type of commerce accounts for more than 90 percent of all EC (excluding services such as healthcare, accommodation, real estate, or finance) in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020a, 2020b). B2B transactions require proprietary information (such as orders for parts) to be communicated to an organization's business partners. For many organizations, keeping such information private can be of strategic value; for example, Apple tries to keep news about potential new product launches to a minimum, and any information about orders for key components (such as touch screens) could give away hints of what a new product may be. Prior to the introduction of the internet and web, the secure communication of proprietary information in B2B EC was facilitated using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) . EDI refers to computer-to-computer communication (without human intervention) following certain standards as set by the UN Economic Commission (for Europe) or the American National Standards Institute. Traditionally, using EDI, the exchange of business documents and other information took place via dedicated telecommunication networks between suppliers and customers, and thus the use of EDI was generally limited to large corporations that could afford the associated expenses. Today, the internet

<!-- image -->

has become an economical medium over which this business-related information can be transmitted, enabling even small to mid-sized enterprises to use EDI; many large companies (such as the retail giant Walmart) require their suppliers to transmit information such as advance shipping notices using web-based EDI protocols. Further, companies have devised a number of innovative ways to facilitate  B2B  transactions  using  web-based  technologies.  Specifically,  organizations increasingly use extranets (see Chapter 3, 'Managing the Information Systems Infrastructure and Services') for exchanging data and handling transactions with their suppliers or organizational customers. Commonly, portals are used to interact with the business partners; these are discussed next.

PORTALS. Portals , in the context of B2B supply chain management, can be defined as access points (or front doors) through which a business partner accesses secured, proprietary information that may be dispersed throughout an organization (typically using extranets). By allowing direct access to critical information needed to conduct business, portals can thus provide substantial productivity gains and cost savings for B2B transactions.

In contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C) EC, where anyone can set up a customer account with a retailer, the suppliers or customers in B2B transactions are typically prescreened by the business, and access to the company's extranet will be given depending on the business relationship (typically, after a review of the supplier's or buyer's application). To support different types of business relationships, portals come in two basic forms: supplier portals and customer portals. Supplier portals are owned or managed by a 'downstream' company and automate the business processes involved in purchasing or procuring products from multiple suppliers; they connect a single buyer and multiple suppliers. On the other end of the spectrum, customer portals are owned or managed by an 'upstream' company and automate the business processes involved in selling or distributing products to multiple buyers; they connect a single supplier und multiple buyers. B2B marketplaces are typically run by separate entities and connect multiple buyers and multiple suppliers (Figure 8.3).

Supplier Portals Many companies that are dealing with large numbers of suppliers (e.g., The Boeing Company, Lilly, P&amp;G, and Hewlett-Packard [HP]) set up supplier portals (sometimes referred to as sourcing portals or procurement portals). A supplier portal is a subset of an organization's extranet designed to automate the business processes that occur before, during, and after sales transactions between the organization (i.e., a single buyer) and its multiple suppliers. For example, on the HP Supplier Portal, companies can register their interest in becoming a supplier for HP; access terms and conditions or guidelines (such as guidelines related to labeling, shipment, or packaging); and, once a business relationship is established with HP, manage interorganizational business processes associated with ordering and payment.

Customer Portals Customer portals are designed to automate the business processes that occur before, during, and after sales transactions between a supplier and multiple customers. In other words, customer portals provide efficient tools for business customers to manage all phases of the purchasing cycle, including reviewing product information, order entry, and customer service (Figure 8.4). For example, MyBoeingFleet, the customer portal of The Boeing Company, is part of Boeing's extranet and allows airplane owners, operators, and other parties to access information about their airplanes' configurations, maintenance documents, or spare parts. In other cases, customer portals are set up as B2B websites that provide custom-tailored offers or specific deals based on sales volume, as is the case with large office retailers such as Office Depot or computer manufacturer Dell, which services business customers through its customer portal Dell Premier.

B2B MARKETPLACES. The purpose of supplier portals and customer portals is to enable interaction between a single company and its many suppliers or customers. Being owned/ operated by a single organization, these portals can be considered a subset of the organization's extranet. However, setting up such portals tends to be beyond the reach of small to midsized businesses because of the costs involved in designing, developing, and maintaining this type of system. Many of these firms do not have the necessary monetary resources or skilled personnel to implement such portals on their own, and the transaction volume does not justify the expenses. To service this market, a number of business-to-business marketplaces have sprung up. B2B marketplaces are operated by third-party vendors, meaning they are built and maintained by a separate entity rather than being associated with a particular buyer or supplier. These marketplaces generate revenue by taking a small commission for each transaction that occurs, by charging usage fees, by charging association fees, and/or by generating advertising revenues. Unlike customer and supplier portals, B2B marketplaces allow many buyers and many sellers to come together, offering firms access to real-time trading with other companies in their vertical markets (i.e., markets composed of firms operating within a certain industry sector). Such B2B marketplaces can create tremendous efficiencies for companies because they bring together numerous participants along the supply network. Some popular B2B marketplaces include https://www.metals1.com (metals), https://www.paperindex.com (paper), and https:// www.fibre2fashion.com (textile and fashion supplies).

In contrast to B2B marketplaces serving vertical markets, other B2B marketplaces are not focused on any particular industry. One of the most successful examples is the Chinese marketplace Alibaba.com. Alibaba.com brings together buyers and suppliers from around the globe, from almost every industry, selling almost any product, ranging from fresh ginger to manufacturing machinery. Alibaba.com offers various services, such as posting item leads, displaying products, and contacting buyers or sellers but also features such as trading tips or price watch for raw materials. Offering various trading tools including online storefronts, virtual factory tours, and real-time chat, such B2B marketplaces have enabled many small or little-known suppliers to engage in trade on a global basis.

## Managing Complex Supply Networks

A prime example of a company having to manage extremely complex supply networks is Apple and its extremely successful mobile devices, such as the iPhone and iPad. Typically, Apple sells millions of these devices within the first few days following the product launch. How does Apple manage to produce such an incredible number of these products? If you take a close look at the devices, you will find a statement saying 'Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China.' Every time a new Apple device is launched, industry observers disassemble these devices to get a sneak peek into Apple's supply chain. The iPhone, like other Apple devices, is by no means manufactured by Apple. The components of the iPhone are sourced from dozens of companies located in various countries. For example, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli, a  recent  iPhone's  flash  memory  and  central  processing  unit  were  produced  by  Korean  Samsung; the display was sourced from Korean LG; the phone chips were made by German Infineon (manufactured in Germany or Southeast Asia); the Wi-Fi and global positioning system (GPS) chips were produced by U.S.-based Broadcom (but possibly assembled in China, Korea, Singapore, or Taiwan); the touchscreen controller was made by Texas Instruments; many other parts, such as the camera, were possibly made in Taiwan; and so on (depending on the requirements, companies such as Apple use various suppliers for different product models). The final products are assembled in a factory owned by Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, located in Shenzhen, China (a city of more than 10 million people located just north of Hong Kong), from where the finished iPhones are shipped by air to the different countries where the iPhone is for sale (Figure 8.5). Although many have never heard of Foxconn, it is the largest electronics manufacturer in the world, producing components, cell phones, gaming consoles, and so on, for various other companies, including Dell, HP, and Sony.

Coordinating such an extensive supply network requires considerable expertise, especially when facing unexpected events such as shortages in touchscreen panels or other issues at suppliers' factories; likewise, global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, can cause disruptions in supply chains, resulting in work stoppages and delayed orders. For example, companies using a 'just in time' inventory philosophy (discussed below) faced shutdowns and delays. It is important to note that the impacts of such events are often not limited to the products

## FIGURE 8.5

manufactured in one country but ripple through supply networks throughout the world. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted supply chains in China also shut down plants around the world, as many key components for downstream products are produced in China; due to shutdowns in China, these components could not be produced and delivered to assembly lines in other countries, creating a domino effect on global supply networks. A limited pool of suppliers for critical components can further exacerbate such problems, as companies have fewer options to switch suppliers if necessary. It is thus important not only to monitor one's own direct suppliers but also to constantly monitor the company's extended supply chain so as to anticipate any issues that may have an impact on one's direct suppliers.

## Benefits of Effectively Managing Supply Chains

Whereas effectively managing the supply chain can create various opportunities, many problems can arise when firms within the network do not collaborate effectively. For example, collaboration within supply networks has enabled process innovations such as just-in-time manufacturing and vendor-managed inventory (discussed in the following sections). On the other hand, if firms do not collaborate effectively, information can easily become distorted as it moves through the supply network. Problems such as excessive inventories, inaccurate manufacturing capacity plans, and missed production schedules can run rampant, causing huge ripple effects that lead to degradations in profitability and poor customer service by everyone within the supply network. Further, effectively managing the supply chain is becoming increasingly important in terms of corporate social responsibility.

JUST-IN-TIME PRODUCTION. One of the most significant advances in manufacturing has been the use of just-in-time (JIT) approaches. Based on the notion that keeping inventory is costly (in terms of both storage costs and the capital that is tied up) and does not add value, companies using a JIT method are trying to optimize their ordering quantities such that parts or raw materials arrive just when they are needed for production. As the orders arrive in smaller quantities (but at higher frequency), the investment in storage space and inventory is minimized. Pioneered by Japanese automaker Toyota, a JIT approach has now been adopted by many other businesses. For example, computer maker Dell realized the problems with keeping large

inventories, especially because of the fast rate of obsolescence of electronics components. To illustrate, recall our discussion of Moore's Law, which suggests that processor technology is doubling in performance approximately every 24 months. Because of this, successful computer manufacturers have learned that holding inventory that can quickly become obsolete or devalued is a poor strategy for success. In fact, Dell now only keeps about 2 hours of inventory in its factories. Obviously, using a JIT method is heavily dependent on tight cooperation between all partners in the supply network, not only suppliers but also other partners, such as shipping and logistics companies.

VENDOR-MANAGED INVENTORY. Under a traditional inventory model, the manufacturer or retailer would manage its own inventories, sending out requests for additional items as needed. In contrast, vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is an approach to inventory management in which the suppliers to a manufacturer (or retailer) manage the manufacturer's (or retailer's) inventory based on negotiated service levels. To make VMI possible, the manufacturer (or retailer) allows the supplier to monitor stock levels and ongoing sales data. Such arrangements can help to optimize the manufacturer's (or retailer's) inventory, both saving costs and minimizing stockout situations (thus enhancing customer satisfaction); the supplier, in turn, benefits from the intense data sharing, which helps produce more accurate forecasts, reduces ordering errors, and helps prioritize the shipment of goods.

REDUCING THE BULLWHIP EFFECT. One major problem affecting supply chains are ripple effects referred to as the bullwhip effect . Each business forecasting demand typically includes a safety buffer to prevent possible stockouts. However, forecast errors and safety stocks multiply when moving up the supply chain, such that a small fluctuation in demand for a product can lead to tremendous fluctuation in demand for parts or raw materials farther up the supply chain. Like someone cracking a bullwhip, a tiny 'flick of the wrist' will create a big movement at the other end of the whip. Likewise, a small forecasting error at the end of the supply chain can cause massive forecasting errors farther up the supply chain. Implementing integrated business processes allows a company to better coordinate the entire supply network and reduce the impact of the bullwhip.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. Effectively managing the supply chain has also become tremendously important for aspects related to corporate social responsibility. Specifically, transparency and accountability within the supply chain can help organizations save costs and/ or create a good image. Two related issues are product recalls and sustainable business practices; both are discussed next.

Product Recalls Given that a typical supply network comprises tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of players, many of which are dispersed across the globe, there are myriad possibilities where shortcuts are being taken or quality standards are not being met. Often, such issues are caught somewhere along the supply chain, but sometimes such incidents go unnoticed until the product reaches the end consumer. These problems can be exacerbated if companies are sourcing their products or raw materials globally, as more potential points of failure are added due to differences in quality or product safety regulations in the originating countries.

Hence, it is extremely important to have the necessary information to trace back the movement of products through the supply chain to be able to quickly identify the problematic link. Being able to single out the source of a problem can help a company to perform an appropriate response, helping to save goodwill and limiting the costs of a recall. Further, in many cases, only some batches of a product may be problematic (such as when certain raw materials or components are sourced from different suppliers). If a company is not able to clearly identify the affected batches, the recall will have to be much broader, costing the company much more (in both goodwill and money) than just having to recall the affected batches. Hence, companies need to have a clear picture of their supply chain and need to store these data in case of problems at a later point in time.

Sustainable Business Practices Another aspect related to corporate social responsibility is a growing emphasis on sustainable business practices. Particularly, organizations have come under increasing scrutiny for issues such as ethical treatment of workers (especially overseas) or environmental practices. For instance, because of Apple's vast success in marketing its products

around the world, the tech giant has also received an abundance of negative press related to the poor conditions for many workers who assemble the world's favorite phone. A typical worker in such plants endures a 12-hour work shift 6 days a week. These workers typically live next to the assembly plant in crowded dorms that are often infested with bedbugs, and many have no working toilets. Over the past several years, there were also reports of numerous workers committing suicide due to the stress and poor conditions. While Apple is certainly aware of the negative effects that a supplier's action can have on a company's reputation, it also faces a conundrum, as few (if any) companies have sufficient production capacity, especially when offering such low wages, to meet the demand for hugely popular products such as the iPhone.

Other companies are trying to portray a 'green' image and attempt to minimize their carbon footprint. For example, HP takes a proactive approach, being the first major information technology company to publish its aggregate supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, restrict the use of hazardous materials, implement environmentally friendly packaging policies, and so on. To do that and to provide sound, convincing numbers to back a 'green' image, a company such as HP needs to have a clear view of its entire supply chain. Similarly, U.S. regulations require 95 percent of computers purchased by the U.S. federal government to carry the EPEAT ecolabel. To achieve this certification, a manufacturer must possess and produce extensive evidence that the products meet EPEAT's strict requirements.

## Optimizing the Supply Chain Through Supply Chain Management

Information systems focusing on improving supply chains have two main objectives: to accelerate product development and innovation and to reduce costs. These systems, called supply chain management (SCM) systems , improve the coordination of suppliers, product or service production, and distribution. When implemented successfully, SCM systems help in not only reducing inventory costs but also enhancing revenue through improved customer service. SCM systems are often integrated with ERP systems to leverage internal and external information to better collaborate with suppliers. Like ERP and customer relationship management systems, SCM systems are delivered in the form of modules (Table 8.1) that companies select and implement according to their differing business requirements.

As discussed previously, ERP systems are primarily used to optimize business processes within the organization, whereas SCM systems are used to improve business processes that span organizational boundaries. Whereas some standalone SCM systems only automate the logistics aspects of the supply chain, organizations can reap the greatest benefits when the SCM system is tightly integrated with ERP and customer relationship management systems modules; this way, SCM systems can use data about customer orders or sales forecasts (from the customer relationship management system), data about payments (from the ERP system), and so on. Given its scope, SCM is adopted primarily by large organizations with a large and/or complex supplier network. At the same time, many smaller suppliers are interacting with the systems of large companies. To obtain the greatest benefits from the SCM processes and systems, organizations need to extend the system to include all trading partners regardless of size, providing a central location for information integration and common processes so that all partners benefit.

For an effective SCM strategy, several challenges have to be overcome. First and foremost, as with any information system, an SCM system is only as good as the data entered into it. This means that to benefit most from an SCM system, the organization's employees have to actually use the system and move away from traditional ways of managing the supply chain, as an order placed by fax or telephone will most likely not find its way into the system. Another challenge to overcome is distrust among partners in the supply chain; for many companies, sales and supply chain data are strategic assets, and no one wants to show his or her cards to other members in the supply chain. Further, many organizations (such as Apple) tend to be very clandestine about their suppliers, as such information could reveal their pricing strategies or give clues about new product development. In addition, more and more organizations are reluctant to share data along the supply chain because of an increase in intellectual property theft, especially in China, a major source of supplies for many companies. A final challenge is to get all partners within the supply chain to adopt an SCM system. Several years ago, the retail giant Walmart began mandating its suppliers to use its RetailLink supply chain system and refused to engage in a business relationship with any supplier that was not willing to use the system. Whereas large companies can force their suppliers or partners to use a system, smaller companies typically do not have this power.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## The Chicken Sandwich War of 2019

Popeye's louisiana Kitchen is a fast food restaurant chain headquartered in the united States that specializes in-you guessed it-chicken. In August 2019, Popeye's launched a new chicken sandwich to compete with Chick-Fil-A and other fast food restaurants. Popeye's leveraged their social media reach during the launch, and experienced massive increases in customer traffic, estimated at well over 100 percent! Their chicken sandwich launch was simultaneously a massive   success and a failure, as Popeye's supply chain was unable to keep pace with demand.

had not accounted for an inventory safety net, and their supply chain failed as a result.

The question remains: did Popeye's artificially create the buzz, knowing their supply chain would not be able to keep up? According to their CEo, no, that wasn't the case. They just didn't account for the viral effects of social media and the apparent deliciousness of their chicken sandwich..

## Based on:

The sandwich was officially announced on August 12, 2019 and sold out more than 3 months of ingredients within the first 2 weeks after launch. during the launch, Popeye's went to war with Chick-Fil-A on social media to debate whose fast food chicken sandwich was better. The debate started when Chick-Fil-A sent a tweet that claimed their sandwich was the original, loved chicken sandwich. Popeye's responded with the two-word tweet 'y'all good?' and the rest is history. Clearly the debate was successful, as some estimate that Popeye's gained more than uS$65 million in media value because of the reach and effect of their social media marketing efforts. unfortunately for Popeye's and their customers, it takes nearly 2 months for a chicken to be raised and harvested. Thus, the uncontrolled spike in demand upset the entire supply chain as it is impossible to decrease the timeframe for producing chicken. Popeye's leadership

## Developing an SCM Strategy

When developing an SCM strategy, an organization must consider a variety of factors that will affect the effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain. Supply chain effectiveness is  the extent to which a company's supply activities meet the requirements of the external partners involved. In contrast, supply chain efficiency is the extent to which a company optimizes the use of resources in its supply chain activities. Focusing on one or the other can result in excessive costs or in not meeting stakeholders' needs, so companies must evaluate the trade-offs in different areas, such as procurement, production, and transportation (Figure 8.6). In other words, the design of the supply chain must consider natural trade-offs between a variety of factors and should match the organization's competitive strategy to offer the greatest benefits. For example, an organization utilizing a low-cost-provider competitive strategy would likely focus on supply chain efficiency. In contrast, an organization pursuing a superior customer service differentiation strategy would focus on supply chain effectiveness.

SCM systems typically allow for making trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness for individual components or raw materials. For example, if a hurricane is likely to delay the arrival of a key component by sea, the company can perform simulations to evaluate the effect of the delay on production and can assess the feasibility of temporarily switching suppliers, switching modes of transportation (e.g., expediting the shipment via air freight), or substituting the component altogether. In such cases, making changes to the original plans may be costlier but can help the organization meet promised delivery deadlines, thus maintaining goodwill and avoiding possible contract penalties. On the other hand, companies can dynamically adjust schedules for noncritical components or raw materials so as to minimize costs while still meeting the targets set in the production schedule.

An SCM system includes more than simply hardware and software; it also integrates business processes and supply chain partners. As shown in Table 8.1, an SCM system consists of many modules or applications. Each of these modules supports supply chain planning, supply chain execution, or supply chain visibility and analytics. All are described next.

## Supply Chain Planning

Supply chain planning involves the development of various resource plans to support the efficient and effective production of goods and services (Figure 8.7). Four key processes are generally supported by supply chain planning modules:

1. Demand Planning and Forecasting. Supply chain planning begins with product demand planning and forecasting. To develop demand forecasts, SCM modules examine historical data to develop the most accurate forecasts possible. The accuracy of these forecasts will be influenced greatly by the stability of the data. When historic data are stable, plans can be longer in duration, whereas if historic data show unpredictable fluctuations in demand, the forecasting time frame must be narrowed. SCM systems also support collaborative demand and supply planning such that a sales representative can work together with the demand planner, taking into account data provided by the organization's point-of-sale system, promotions entered in the customer relationship management system, and other factors

influencing demand. Demand planning and forecasting leads to the development of the overall demand forecast .

2. Distribution Planning. Once demand forecasts are finalized, plans for moving products to distributors can be developed. Specifically, distribution planning focuses on delivering products or services to consumers as well as warehousing, delivering, invoicing, and payment collection. Distribution planning leads to the development of the overall transportation plan .
3. Production Scheduling. Production scheduling focuses on the coordination of all activities needed to create the product or service. When developing this plan, analytical tools are

## GREEN IT

## Nike's Green Supply Chain

Consumerism, globalization, and mass production are creating large costs for economies, societies, and the environment, with negative effects arising everywhere from resource extraction to manufacturing to the disposal of products. Having realized this, more and more companies are striving to reduce these impacts, aiming to improve their economic, environmental, and social performance through reducing the use of resources, eliminating or reusing waste, or renewing resources by recovering materials from used products. Green supply chain management includes green supply chain planning, green procurement, green distribution, and green logistics. For example, already during the planning stage, products can be engineered to reduce their environmental impact, such as by using recycled materials or designing products to be easily recyclable at the end of their lifetime. Better demand and supply planning can also help reduce excess production. When procuring components or raw materials, companies can strive to use sustainable sources, or collaborate with and provide incentives to their suppliers. When packing and shipping goods, companies can use green packaging (e.g., using cardboard rather than Styrofoam), recycle or reuse packaging materials, utilize alternative fuel vehicles, or group shipments to reduce the number of trips needed. At all stages in the supply chain of a product, responsible companies increasingly strive to minimize their carbon footprint.

As with almost all business processes, information systems play a key role in enabling green supply chain management, evaluating performance, and helping to continuously improve the performance of the green supply chain. The sportswear company nike is but one of many organizations that have realized the many benefits of a green supply chain and sustainable manufacturing. nike is continuously innovating with the aim of 'doubling [its] business while halving [its] impact,' focusing not only on what they produce, but also on how they produce it and what they produce it from. nike starts with trying to source regenerative or reclaimed materials, which can be reused after a product's life. In manufacturing, nike uses information-systems enabled innovations such as 3d printing or digital knitting, which not only reduce waste and improve working conditions, but also help to increase efficiency and enable mass customization. Having realized that sustainability is a common goal, nike even open-sourced many of its sustainable innovations, promoting sustainability throughout the industry. Fueled by its innovative products, nike's success shows that focusing on a green supply chain can not only minimize a company's environmental footprint, but also result in benefits to the company's bottom line.

- used to optimally utilize materials, equipment, and labor. Production also involves product testing, packaging, and delivery preparation. Production scheduling leads to the development of the production plan .
4. Inventory and Safety Stock Planning. Inventory and safety stock planning focuses on the development of inventory estimates. Using inventory simulations and other analytical techniques, organizations can balance inventory costs and desired customer service levels to determine optimal inventory levels. Once inventory levels are estimated, suppliers are chosen who contractually agree to preestablished delivery and pricing terms. Inventory and safety stock planning leads to the development of a sourcing plan .

As suggested, various types of analytical tools-such as statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization-are used to forecast and visualize demand levels, distribution and warehouse locations, resource sequencing, and so on. Once these plans are developed, they are used to guide supply chain execution. Additionally, it is important to note that SCM planning is an ongoing process-as new data are obtained, plans are updated. For example, if shortages in the capacity for manufacturing touchscreen displays suddenly become evident, Apple has to dynamically adjust its plans so as to obtain the needed quantities to meet customer demand.

## Supply Chain Execution

Supply chain execution is the execution of supply chain planning. Essentially, supply chain execution puts the planning into motion and reflects the processes involved in improving the   collaboration of all members of the supply chain-suppliers, producers, distributors, and   customers. Supply chain execution involves the management of three key elements of the supply chain: product flow, information flow, and financial flow (Figure 8.8). Each of these flows is discussed next.

PRODUCT FLOW. Product flow refers  to  the  movement of goods from the supplier to production, from production to distribution, and from distribution to the consumer. Although products primarily 'flow' in one direction, an effective SCM system will also support the activities associated with product returns. Effectively processing returns and customer refunds and recycling or properly disposing of products after the end of their life span are critical parts of supply chain execution. Thus, an SCM system should support not only the 'downstream' forward logistics processes but also reverse logistics . Reverse logistics refers to the processes in place to efficiently receive products from the point of consumption. With an increasing need to recapture value by reusing or recycling materials, recovering these after use is an important aspect of managing product flows, and companies need to plan reverse logistics, where materials flow back from the consumer to the producer, so that valuable materials can be recycled, or hazardous materials can be properly disposed of. In case of receiving excessive or defective products, these processes also include shipping replacements or crediting customer accounts.

As introduced in Chapter 3, RFID (radio frequency identification) systems offer great opportunities for managing supply chains, and virtually all major retailers are adopting RFID to better manage product flows, as are governments for tracking military supplies and weapons, drug shipments and ingredients (i.e., for eliminating counterfeit drugs), and citizens with RFID chips on passports.

INFORMATION FLOW. Information flow refers to the movement of information along the supply chain, such as order processing and delivery status updates. Like the product flow, information can also flow up or down the supply chain as needed. The key element to the information flow is the complete removal of paper documents. Specifically, as all information about orders, fulfillment, billing, and consolidation is shared electronically, these paperless information flows

| Supply Chain Execution   | Supplier                 | Production           | Distribution      | Consumption   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Product Flow             | Raw Materials            | Manufactured Product | Product Inventory | Product       |
| Information Flow         | Delivery Status, Updates |                      |                   |               |
| Financial Flow           |                          |                      |                   | Payments      |

save not only paperwork but also time and money. Additionally, because SCM systems use a central database to store data, all supply chain partners must continuously have access to the most current data necessary for scheduling production, shipping orders, and so on.

Extensible Markup Language A key enabler for optimizing information flows is Extensible Markup Language (XML) . XML is a standard for exchanging structured data over the web. XML allows creating documents consisting of customized tags, enabling the definition, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.

As described in Chapter 3, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) uses tags to specify the structure and content of a document-such as a web page-that will be presented by a user's browser. Much like HTML, XML also uses tags but focuses on sharing data between applications. An XML tag is a label that is inserted into an XML document to specify how the data contained in the document or a portion of the document should be interpreted and/or used. For example, the tags &lt;item\_no&gt; . . . &lt;/item\_no&gt; would instruct the application reading the XML file that the numbers enclosed in the tags should be interpreted as a product's item number (Figure 8.9). The application could use this information when displaying a product on a web page or when updating inventory records. As a result, XML is a powerful tagging system that can be tailored to share data across applications over the web. With these advanced data definition capabilities built into web applications, organizations can use the web as the worldwide network for electronic commerce and SCM.

XML has become the standard for automating data exchange between business information systems and may well replace all other formats for electronic data interchange. Companies can, for example, use XML to create applications for web-based ordering, for checking on and managing inventory, for signaling to a supplier that more parts are needed, for alerting a third-party logistics company that a delivery is needed, and so on. All these various applications can work together using the common language of XML.

XML is customizable, and variations of XML have been developed. For example, Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is an XML-based specification for publishing financial information. XBRL makes it easier for public and private companies to share information with each other, with industry analysts, and with shareholders. XBRL includes tags for data such as annual and quarterly reports, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, general ledger information, and net revenue and accounting schedules (Figure 8.10). Similarly, many applications, such as Microsoft Office or OpenOffice, use XML-based file formats, such as Microsoft's Open XML or the Open Document Format (ODF).

FINANCIAL FLOW. Financial flow refers primarily to the movement of financial assets throughout the supply chain. Financial flows also include information related to payment schedules, consignment and ownership of products and materials, and other relevant information.

Linkages to electronic banking and financial institutions allow payments to automatically flow into the accounts of all members within the supply chain.

Managing B2B Financial Transactions In B2C electronic commerce, most transactions are settled using credit cards or electronic payment services such as PayPal; in contrast, B2B payments are lagging far behind. In fact, according to some estimates, about 75 percent of all noncash B2B payments in the United States are made by check. While this may sound archaic, the time needed to process a check serves as a form of trade credit, which can amount to a significant part of an organization's working capital. For smaller purchases, organizations also often use purchasing cards. However, although productivity gains can be realized from using purchasing cards instead of checks, such cards are typically not used for large B2B transactions because of preset spending limits. In global B2B transactions, organizations often use letters of credit issued by a bank to make payments. While letters of credit help to reduce credit risk, these are often used only for relatively large amounts. Alternatively, businesses can make international transfers using providers such as Western Union. In any case, making a B2B payment is far from being as simple as making a purchase at Amazon using your credit card, and making B2B payments easier can greatly enhance efficiency as well as reduce costs for organizations. Thus, it is no wonder that businesses have started asking for payment methods as simple as PayPal for B2B transactions, and major banks have started collaborating with fintech companies to develop new B2B payment systems. When dealing with new, unknown suppliers, there is considerable fraud risk involved; this is especially of concern in global EC, so businesses often use third-party escrow services, which release payment only when the buyer has confirmed satisfactory delivery of the goods, reducing the risks for the buyer.

## Supply Chain Visibility and Analytics

Supply chain visibility refers to the ability not only to track products as they move through the supply chain but also to foresee external events. Being able to see where a shipment is at any given time can be of tremendous help, especially when using JIT methods or when maintaining low inventory levels. For example, knowing where a shipment is and being able to expedite it can help in not losing a sale or help in taking away a sale from a competitor. Further, knowing where a supplier's facilities are located can help to anticipate and react to issues arising from adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, or political issues; if I don't know where in Taiwan my suppliers' factories are located, how will I know whether they might be affected by a fastapproaching typhoon? Similarly, some companies even want to know when labor contracts of key suppliers' workers expire in order to plan for potential labor disputes. Such levels of information sharing throughout the supply chain require tremendous trust among the partners. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled various ways of enhancing supply chain visibility. For example, sensors or on-board telematics units can transmit data about the location of trucks, enabling real-time location monitoring as well as making accurate predictions about when shipments will arrive.

Further,  various  sensors  can  provide  valuable  information  about  the  condition  of  shipments throughout all phases of the journey; temperature or humidity sensors can provide information about whether sensitive goods have been kept within the correct temperature or humidity range, or sensors or cameras can be used to send alerts if a shipment has been tampered with.

Supply chain analytics refers to the use of key performance indicators to monitor performance of the entire supply chain, including sourcing, planning, production, and distribution. For example, a purchasing manager can identify the suppliers that are frequently unable to meet promised delivery dates. Being able to access key performance metrics can help to identify and remove bottlenecks, such as by switching suppliers, spreading orders over multiple suppliers, expediting shipping for critical goods, and so on. With the increase in available data from a variety of sources, ranging from IoT sensors used in logistics to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors used in manufacturing to news reports about global events, Big Data analytics plays an increasingly important role in optimizing supply chains.

## Managing Supply Chains Using Blockchain Technology

Among the biggest challenges of managing complex supply chains are lack of transparency, difficulties in connecting different vendors and suppliers, and difficulties in investigating suppliers' legal or ethical issues. One development that has been touted as revolutionizing information flows in supply chains is blockchain technology. As discussed in Chapter 4, 'Enabling Businessto-Consumer Electronic Commerce,' a blockchain is a distributed public ledger, on which all transactions are recorded as blocks; Bitcoin is the most well-known example of a cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology. As each block is linked to the previous and the following block, and  as  the  ledger  is  distributed  across  numerous  computers,  blockchains  are  highly  resilient against tampering. In addition, there is no need for central authorities coordinating or ensuring the veracity of transactions, and the elimination of the need for trusted middlemen allows for transactions to be triggered and executed automatically.

Given these benefits, blockchains are often regarded as being highly secure and helping increase efficiency and transparency, and many organizations are actively exploring ways in which blockchain technology can be used for improving supply chains. A primary application is smart contracts, where transactions and funds transfers are executed automatically if a certain condition is met. Another promising application is tracing products from the source. For example, De Beers, the world's largest producer of diamonds, uses blockchain technology to track the movement of diamonds from the point of mining to the store. This allows tracing the origins of the diamonds, assuring customers that the diamonds are genuine, and helping the company avoid purchasing or selling diamonds of questionable origin (e.g., 'blood diamonds'). Likewise, large food and retail companies (such as Walmart) experiment with the use of blockchains to trace the origins of the produce from farm to store, in an attempt to minimize issues related to food safety or to guarantee the origins of organic foods.

Yet critics of blockchain technology point out that blockchains cannot solve some of the underlying problems in supply chains. Whereas blockchains are often lauded for their potential to eliminate the need for trust, this need for trust does not actually disappear; rather than trusting others, we will have to trust software, which is even more difficult to understand than other humans. Likewise, except when data is automatically entered (e.g., using IoT sensors), we still have to trust that someone entered the data correctly; if a producer of organic mangoes uses forbidden pesticides, using a blockchain will not resolve this issue (and tracking items that are not physically unique will not be magically made possible by using blockchain). Even if data are automatically captured and entered, we still must trust the manufacturer of the sensor, the software vendor, and so on (and by now, we know that virtually no software is without bugs). As usual, the old adage applies, 'garbage in, garbage out.' Bad data quality cannot be overcome merely by using blockchain technology. Another drawback that directly results from one of blockchain's biggest benefits is the irreversibility of transactions. Once a transaction is executed, there is no way to reverse it, and without a trusted middleman, organizations have no recourse in case something goes wrong (intentionally or unintentionally). Finally, while smart contracts do not take the form of lengthy unintelligible legal documents, smart contracts still need to be audited, and software code is much more difficult to audit than contract policies written in English. In sum, blockchain technology offers much potential (and is greatly hyped up by consulting companies jumping on the blockchain bandwagon), but only time will tell if it will indeed revolutionize supply chain management.

## FIGURE 8.11

Today's empowered customers have many ways to obtain and spread information and opinions about companies.

## Customer Relationship Management

With the changes introduced by the web, in most industries a company's competition is simply a mouse click away. It is increasingly important for companies not only to generate new business but also to attract repeat business from existing customers. This means that, to remain competitive, companies must keep their customers satisfied. In today's highly competitive markets, customers hold the balance of power; if customers become dissatisfied with the levels of customer service they are receiving, they have many alternatives readily available.

It is important to note that customers are not just the end consumer but also other businesses in B2B transactions. As mentioned earlier, B2B e-commerce is many times larger than businessto-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. So, any rules or best practices for keeping customers happy apply to not only retailers but also any company within a supply chain. In the past, companies would try to establish long-term relationships with business customers, and establishing relationships with end customers was virtually impossible, especially for large companies. Today, the emphasis has shifted from conducting business transactions to managing relationships even when dealing with individual customers. If a company successfully manages its relationships with customers-satisfying them and solving their problems-then customers are less price sensitive. Hence, leveraging and managing customer relationships is equally as important as product development. Indeed, customer relationship management systems often collect data that can be mined to discover the next product line extension that customers covet.

The increasing digital density and the rise in the use of social media, Big Data, cloud computing, and IoT have tremendously changed the way organizations need to interact with their customers. Some researchers argue that we have moved from the internet age to the age of the customer. The age of the customer is characterized by customers being part of social circles and being increasingly empowered by social media (Figure 8.11). For example, customers have much more access to information from various sources; at the same time, customers' word of mouth can be spread anywhere, anytime using mobile devices and has a much wider reach through social media such as blogs, Twitter, or Facebook. This can pose tremendous challenges for organizations trying to present and maintain a positive public image, as unmonitored conversations can have huge negative impacts, and monitoring and participating in ongoing conversations can be an important part of shaping public opinion. In addition, companies face significant changes in the competitive landscape. For example, the internet has freed customers from having to purchase goods locally and has thus lowered the barriers to entry for potential rivals. Similarly, many products have been replaced or marginalized by digital substitutes. The power of buyers has increased, as people can quickly and easily find information, reviews, or prices at a competitor's store. At the same time, employees, an important source of supply, have more mobility and thus have higher power. Last but not least, not only one's customers but also one's competitors have tremendous amounts of information about one's products (and their strengths and weaknesses) available at their fingertips and can more easily predict one's next strategic move. Thus, businesses must rethink their interactions with customers; rather than seeing customers as a passive audience, organizations must engage in conversations with their customers. In their attempts to engage with customers and build long-lasting relationships, organizations are

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Augmenting Supply Chain Success

In the 2002 film Minority Report , Tom Cruise used gestures and natural language to interact with a futuristic computer that displayed information on massive screens that surrounded him. Today, such interaction is no longer science fiction but science fact. Augmented reality (AR) refers to interactions in a live direct or indirect view of a physical, realworld environment that is augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, or GPS data. visual information, for example, can be presented on optical projection systems, monitors, handheld devices, and so on. Such information can be provided on a heads-up display using a headset or eyeglasses or be projected onto large screens or even a vehicle's windshield.

heads-up display on how to most efficiently arrange cargo given the size, dimension, and weight of the items. When delivering items, AR can provide more than widely used GPS navigation by providing a heads-up windshield display with real-time traffic analysis so rerouting can occur on the fly without any interactions that might distract the driver. Additional information about the cargo can also be provided if needed (e.g., temperature sensitive items). And the best part of this is that workers using AR support will feel like Tom Cruise in Minority Report .

## Based on:

Many believe that AR is going to transform various aspects of supply chain management. For example, an important part of assembling or packing orders is the picking process, where a human 'picks' components or completed items for assembly or delivery. AR can allow each picker to see a 'digital packing list' on a heads-up display. When an item is selected in a warehouse, the heads-up display can then show the most efficient path to the next item to pick, guiding the person perfectly to the next step in the process. virtually no mistakes or missteps are made. once products are collected to be shipped, AR can also aid in loading containers and trucks by providing step-by-step instructions on a

Likewise, the IoT serves as a source for additional data not only about customers but also about their usage of products and can offer various opportunities to offer customers better value.

Many of the world's most successful corporations have realized the importance of developing and nurturing relationships with their customers. For example, Starbucks Coffee uses a variety of means to engage with its customers. Like many other businesses, Starbucks uses a loyalty card to entice people to return to its stores; further, Starbucks actively solicits feedback and new product ideas from its customers, not only within the stores but also via its open innovation platform   https://ideas.starbucks.com  , and it has one of the most successful fan pages on Facebook. Computer manufacturer Dell, in contrast, has different needs when interacting with its customers. For instance, when Dell sales representatives are dealing with large corporate clients that routinely make large computer purchases, issues of quantity pricing and delivery are likely to be paramount, whereas when dealing with less-computer-savvy individuals ordering a new notebook for personal use, questions about compatibility with an older printer or the ability to run a specific program may be asked. No matter the customer, Dell attempts to provide all customers with a positive experience during both the presale and the ongoing support phases. Large banks and insurance companies are trying to widen and deepen relationships with customers in order to sell more financial services and products, maximizing the lifetime value of each individual customer. Chase Card Services, for example, has more than 4,000 agents handling 200 million customer calls a year. Being able to increase first-call resolution (sometimes referred to as firstcontact resolution), that is, addressing the customers' issues during the first contact, can help to save costs tremendously while increasing customer satisfaction.

Marketing researchers have found that the cost of trying to win back customers who have gone elsewhere can be up to 50 to 100 times as much as keeping a current one satisfied. Thus,

Transform Minor Customers into Profitable Customers companies are finding it imperative to develop and maintain customer satisfaction and widen (by attracting new customers), lengthen (by keeping existing profitable customers satisfied), and deepen (by transforming minor customers into profitable customers) the relationships with their customers in order to compete effectively in their markets (Figure 8.12). To achieve this, companies need to not only understand who their customers are but also determine the lifetime value of each customer. With the increasing popularity of social media such as social networks, blogs, and microblogs, companies have more ways than ever to learn about their customers.

To assist in deploying an organization-wide strategy for managing these increasingly complex customer relationships, organizations are deploying customer relationship management (CRM) systems . CRM is not simply a technology but also a corporate-level strategy to create and maintain, through the introduction of reliable systems, processes, and procedures, lasting relationships with customers by concentrating on downstream information flows. Applications focusing on downstream information flows have three main objectives: to attract potential customers, to create customer loyalty, and to portray a positive corporate image. The appropriate CRM technology combined with the management of sales-related business processes can have tremendous benefits for an organization (Table 8.2). To pursue customer satisfaction as a basis for achieving competitive advantage, organizations must be able to access data and track customer interactions throughout the organization regardless of where, when, or how the interaction occurs. This means that companies need to have an integrated system that captures data from retail stores, websites, social networks, microblogs, call centers, and various other channels that organizations use to communicate downstream within their value chain. More important, managers need the capability to monitor and analyze factors that drive customer satisfaction (as well as dissatisfaction) as changes occur according to prevailing market conditions.

CRM systems come in the form of packaged software that is purchased (or 'rented' as a service) from software vendors. CRM systems are commonly integrated with a comprehensive ERP implementation to leverage internal and external information to better serve customers. Thus, most large vendors of ERP systems, such as Oracle, SAP , and Microsoft, also offer CRM systems; further, specialized vendors, such as Salesforce.com or SugarCRM, offer CRM solutions on a software-as-a-service basis. Like ERP, CRM systems come with various features and modules. Managers must carefully select a CRM system that will meet the unique requirements of their business processes.

Companies that have successfully implemented CRM systems can experience greater customer satisfaction and increased productivity of their sales and service personnel, which can translate into dramatic enhancements to the company's profitability. CRM allows organizations to focus on driving revenue as well as on reducing costs as opposed to emphasizing only cost cutting. Cost cutting tends to have a lower limit because there are only so many costs that companies can reduce, whereas revenue generation strategies are bound only by the size of the market itself. The importance of focusing on customer satisfaction is emphasized by findings that institutional investors increase a company's valuation when customer satisfaction is higher and reduce valuations when customer satisfaction is lower (Aalto University, 2013).

## Developing a CRM Strategy

To develop a successful CRM strategy, organizations must do more than simply purchase and install CRM software. The first consideration is whether a comprehensive CRM system is even needed for a company; for example, the closer an organization is to the end customer, the more important CRM becomes, and a larger number of customers (both business customers and end consumers) increases the value a CRM system can provide. Further, companies must realize that a successful CRM strategy must include enterprise-wide changes, including changes to:

- ■ Policies and Business Processes. Organizational policies and procedures need to reflect a customer-focused culture.
- ■ Customer Service. Key metrics for managing the business need to reflect customer-focused measures for quality and satisfaction as well as process changes to enhance the customer experience.
- ■ Employee Training. Employees from all areas-marketing, sales, and support-must have a consistent focus that values customer service and satisfaction.
- ■ Data Collection, Analysis, and Sharing. All aspects of the customer experience-prospecting, sales, support, and so on-must be tracked, analyzed, and shared to optimize the benefits of the CRM.

In sum, the organization must focus and organize its activities to provide the best customer service possible (Figure 8.13). Additionally, a successful CRM strategy must carefully consider the ethical and privacy concerns of customers' data (discussed later in this chapter).

## Architecture of a CRM System

A comprehensive CRM system comprises three primary components:

1. Operational CRM. Systems for automating the fundamental business processesmarketing, sales, and support-for interacting with the customer
2. Analytical CRM. Systems for analyzing customer behavior and perceptions (e.g., quality, price, and overall satisfaction) in order to provide business intelligence
3. Collaborative CRM. Systems for providing effective and efficient communication with the customer from the entire organization

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Hacking Customer Data Can Protect the Most Vulnerable

like many of us, children seek entertainment from digital devices such as computers, tablets, and internet-connected toys. These sources of entertainment often require the child or the parent to set up an account and provide personal information so that the company providing the good can better understand and communicate with their customers. Accordingly, these data are generally stored in some type of CRM. unfortunately, these systems have been breached in several high-profile cases.

issues). The Webkinz hacker, however, may have been malicious, as the account data was leaked on the internet.

In november 2015, the app store 'learning lodge' by vTech was compromised by hackers who obtained customers' names, addresses, passwords, and other personal data, including 190 GB of photos and chat logs. The data breach exposed personal data about millions of individuals, including children, who had accounts that allowed them to register or utilize services related to specific products. In April 2020, 23 million Webkinz accounts were hacked with usernames, passwords, and email addresses compromised. The popular game Roblox was also compromised in early 2020, with an attacker gaining access to 100 million accounts, including the ability to reset passwords and defeat multi-factor authentication.

Whereas companies are increasingly focusing on ways to better connect with customers, these breaches highlight the dark side of CRM in the digital world. Fortunately, the hackers in two of these examples didn't appear to be malicious. After completing the vTech and Roblox breaches, hackers in each case contacted the website Motherboard and provided files containing the sensitive data to prove that vTech's and Roblox's sites had been compromised (the Roblox hacker also attempted to claim a 'bug bounty' for discovering security

Besides damaging the reputation of the breached companies, leaked children's data could be used maliciously to harm the children and their parents by gaining access to their accounts and leveraging their private information to do harm. Further, breached account information could be used to launch a cascading effect on other systems (i.e., using the account information from one site to attack another site), harming the children even further. unfortunately, no system is without vulnerabilities, and every system connected to the internet is subject to attack by malicious crackers. Fortunately, 'white hat' hackers try to access systems to make a point-ultimately helping detect vulnerabilities and making systems. more secure.

## FIGURE 8.14

A comprehensive CRM environment includes operational, analytical, and collaborative components.

Operational CRM enables direct interaction with customers; in contrast, analytical CRM provides the analyses necessary to manage the sales, service, and marketing activities more effectively. Whereas analytical CRM aids in the development of a company's CRM strategy, operational CRM aids in the execution of CRM strategy; thus, either component alone provides no real benefit for a business. Finally, collaborative CRM provides the communication capabilities of the CRM environment (Figure 8.14). Next, we examine each of these components.

OPERATIONAL CRM. Operational CRM includes the systems used to enable customer interaction and service. For example, operational CRM systems help create mass email marketing campaigns wherein each consumer receives an individualized email based on prior purchase history. With an effective operational CRM environment, organizations can provide personalized and highly efficient customer service. Customer-focused personnel are provided complete customer information-history, pending sales, and service requests-to optimize interaction and service. It is important to stress that the operational CRM environment provides all customer information regardless of the touch point (i.e., technical support, customer service, and in-store sales as well as website interactions such as downloading content and e-commerce clickstream data). This means that marketing, sales, and support personnel see all prior and current interactions with the customer regardless of where it occurred within the organization. To facilitate the sharing of information and customer interaction, three separate modules are utilized (Figure 8.15).

Sales Force Automation The first component of an operational CRM is sales force automation (SFA) . SFA refers to modules that support the day-to-day sales activities of an organization. For example, companies such as Dell have thousands of sales staff in various countries working with many different clients. Unless sales personnel and sales managers have an integrated view of Dell's entire sales pipeline, Dell sales staff may be competing for the same contracts unbeknownst to each other. SFA supports a broad range of sales-related business processes, such as order processing and tracking; managing accounts, contacts, opportunities, and sales; and tracking and managing customer history and preferences (both in terms of product and communication). Together, this can help in creating more accurate sales forecasts and analyzing sales performance.

SFA systems provide advantages for sales personnel, sales managers, and marketing managers. For sales personnel, SFA reduces the potentially error-prone paperwork associated with the selling process. Because all the information is within the system, personnel can more easily hand off work and collaborate; it is also easier to train new personnel.

Sales personnel can then use their time more efficiently and ultimately focus more on selling than on paperwork and other non-selling tasks. Likewise, for sales managers, the SFA system provides tremendous benefits, such as accurate, up-to-the-minute information on all customers, markets, and sales personnel. This improved information allows for better planning, scheduling, and coordination. Ultimately, SFA provides better day-to-day management of the sales function. For example, SFA allows sales managers to track a plethora of sales performance measures, such as the sales pipeline for each salesperson, including rating and probability (Figure 8.16), revenue per salesperson, per territory, or as a percentage of sales quota, or number of calls per day, time spent per contact, revenue per call, cost per call, or ratio of orders to calls. Further, sales managers can obtain other useful information such as number

<!-- image -->

of lost customers per period or cost of customer acquisition; product-related information such as margins by product category, customer segment, or customer; or percentage of goods returned, number of customer complaints, or number of overdue accounts. All of these measures aid in assessing sales performance and detecting potential problems in certain regions or issues with product or service quality.

Finally, SFA improves the effectiveness of the marketing function by providing an improved understanding of market conditions, competitors, and products. This enhanced information will provide numerous advantages for the management and execution of the marketing function. Specifically, SFA aids in gaining a better understanding of markets, segments, and customers as well as competitors and the overall economic structure of the industry. Such broad and deep understanding of the competitive landscape can help organizations assess their unique strengths and weaknesses, thereby facilitating new product development and improving strategic planning.

In sum, the primary goals of SFA are to better identify potential customers, streamline selling processes, and improve managerial information. Next, we examine systems for improving customer service and support.

Customer Service and Support The second component of an operational CRM system is customer service and support . Customer service and support refers to modules that automate responses to service requests, complaints, product returns, and information requests. In the past, organizations had help desks and call centers to provide customer service and support. Today, organizations are deploying customer engagement centers that use multiple communication channels to support the communication preferences of customers, such as the web, the company's Facebook page, industry blogs, face-to-face contact, telephone, and so on (see the section 'Collaborative CRM' later in this chapter). A customer engagement center utilizes a variety of communication technologies for optimizing customers' communications with the organization. For example, automatic call distribution systems forward calls to the next available person; while waiting to connect, customers can be given the option to use the keypad or voice response technologies to check account status information. Southwest Airlines improves customer service by using 'virtual hold technology,' where customers can choose to stay on the line or be called back when the next agent is available; this helped to save almost 25 million toll minutes in just one year and reduced the number of abandoned calls, which provided additional opportunities for ticket sales and signals increased customer satisfaction. In essence, the goal of customer service and support is to provide great customer service-anytime, anywhere, and through any channel-while keeping service and support costs low. For example, many customer engagement centers use powerful self-service diagnostic tools that guide consumers to their needed information. Customers can log service requests or gain updates to pending support requests using a variety of self-service or assisted technologies (Figure 8.17). On their websites, companies increasingly use automated chatbots (see Chapter 6, 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence') to initiate conversations and gain preliminary information from the user in order to route the user to the relevant human customer service representative. Successful customer service and support systems enable faster response times, increased first-contact resolution rates, and improved productivity of service and support personnel. Managers can utilize digital dashboards to monitor key metrics such as first-contact resolution and service personnel utilization, which allows for improved management of the service and support functions.

Enterprise Marketing Management The third component of an operational CRM system is enterprise marketing management . Enterprise marketing management tools help a company in the execution of the CRM strategy by improving the management of promotional campaigns (Figure 8.18). Today, many companies use a variety of channels (such as email, telephone, direct mail, Facebook pages and YouTube channels, Twitter status updates, and so on; see Chapter 4, 'Enabling Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce,' and Chapter 5, 'Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media') to reach potential customers and drive them to web pages customized for their target market (based on demographics and lifestyle). Using enterprise marketing management tools can help integrate those campaigns such that the right messages are sent to the right people through the right channels. This necessitates that customer lists

## Using Mobile CRM to Understand Your Customers

In the past, mobile CRM was focused primarily on allowing employees on the go to use mobile devices to access, update, and interact with customer data wherever they are. These mobile CRM solutions let mobile workers do everything they could do with CRM at their desktop. CRM mobility, in organizations where the sales staff is frequently in the field, is a critical component to the CRM solution and has a significant impact on sales performance for staff and the company.

Mobile CRM is not just for a company's employees anymore, but it is also for customers. Today, mobile apps have become a powerful way for customers to connect with a brand. Mobile apps allow customers to access useful content and information while on the go. Smart companies will carefully design a mobile CRM app to leverage the mobile platform, not just repurpose a set of desktop features. Effective strategies for mobile, for example, will leverage push notifications, and provide personalized and relevant messages based on specific events, segmentation criteria, and in-app behavior.

build the right app for customers. The real measure of mobile CRM success is not initial downloads but how many people remain engaged 30 to 60 days after initial engagement. To be successful, companies need specific metrics to measure progress and success. How many customers opt in and download the app, how long customers remain engaged, what events motivate interaction, when push notifications convert to sales, and various other factors must be tracked to learn and sharpen the organization's strategy. Mobile CRM is much more than a replication of a traditional CRM strategy. The company must put the user first and design an app that helps to increase customer engagement and loyalty.

At the same time, enterprise marketing management tools provide extensive analytical capabilities that can help to analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and can help to efficiently route sales leads to the right salespeople, leading to higher conversion rates.

ANALYTICAL CRM. Analytical CRM focuses on analyzing customer behavior and perceptions in order to provide the business intelligence necessary to identify new opportunities and to provide superior customer service. Organizations that effectively utilize analytical CRM can more easily customize marketing campaigns from the segment level to even the individual customer. Such customized campaigns help to increase cross- or up-selling (i.e., selling more profitable products or identifying popular bundles of products and services tailored to different market segments) as well as retain customers by having accurate, timely, and personalized information. Analytical CRM systems are also used to spot sales trends by ZIP code, state, and region as well as specific target markets within those areas.

Key technologies within analytical CRM systems include Big Data analytics and other business intelligence technologies that attempt to create predictive models of various customer attributes    (see    Chapter    6  )  .  These  analyses  can  focus  on  enhancing  a  broad  range  of customer-focused business processes; for example, marketing campaign analysis can help organizations to optimize campaigns by improving customer segmentation and sales coverage as well as by optimizing the use of each customer's preferred communication channels. Similarly, analytical CRM tools can help in analyzing customer acquisition and retention. In addition, analytical CRM tools help in pricing optimization by building models of customer demand, taking into consideration not only factors such as product usage and customer satisfaction but also price, quality, and satisfaction of competitors' products or services.

Many people interact with a company in many different ways using various online identities.

<!-- image -->

Once these predictive models are created, they can be delivered to marketing and sales managers using a variety of visualization methods, including digital dashboards and other reporting methods (Figure 8.19). To gain the greatest value from analytical CRM applications, data collection and analysis must be continuous so that all decision making reflects the most   accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date information.

One goal that customer-focused organizations are constantly striving for is to get a 360-degree view of the customer to be able to maximize the outcomes of sales and marketing campaigns and to identify the most profitable customers. In order to get the most complete picture of a sales prospect or a customer, marketers have to tie together data from various sources, such as demographic data provided when signing up for a loyalty card program, the customer's address, purchase and contact history, clickstream data on the company's website, and so on. In addition to the data captured when interacting with a person, marketers can complete the picture with publicly available information posted on the person's Facebook or LinkedIn profile or the person's Twitter updates. Unfortunately, many people have various online identities (e.g., for different social networks), use multiple email addresses, and access websites from different computers (Figure 8.20). Analytical CRM systems can help merge

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## When Algorithms Discriminate

Promising companies the ability to get to know their customers and maximize the benefit gained from each one, CRM systems could be called a marketer's dream. CRM software allows companies to look closely at customer behavior, drilling down to smaller and smaller market segments. once so segmented, customers can be targeted with specific promotions. For the company, this process reaps the greatest returns from marketing efforts because only those customers are targeted who are likely to respond to the marketing campaign.

From a customer's perspective, CRM systems seem like a great idea. you finally stop receiving advertisements for things that don't interest you. But what if a company uses its CRM software in a more discriminating way? Where do companies draw the line between using CRM data to offer certain clients customized deals and unethically discriminating against other customers? For example, lenders, which often segment their customers according to their creditworthiness, might use this credit risk data to target customers having a low credit rating with underhanded payday or subprime loans. Although these customers are riskier for the lender, the higher fees and interest charged for credit make these customers especially lucrative.

displayed an advertisement for high-income jobs for men more often than for women. Similarly, ads for accessing arrest records were significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively black names. In a similar way, CRM systems based on biased or discriminatory algorithms can potentially do more harm than good, destroying rather than building customer relationships.

## Questions

1. Whose responsibility is it to ensure that algorithms are not discriminatory? Explain.
2. Google, Facebook, and many other widely used software platforms have been accused of using algorithms that present biased search results or news feeds. Should such platforms be bias free (at least as much as possible), or is it acceptable for platforms to reflect the biases of the developers? Explain.

CRM and all software contain countless algorithms for manipulating, aggregating, and summarizing data. Algorithms reflect a set of rules to be followed in calculations and other problem-solving operations. While there is a widespread belief that such algorithms must be objective and fair, CRM software, and the underlying algorithms, is not free of human bias. Instances of bias reported in the popular press include a report that Google's online advertising system

different   identities by using fuzzy logic-based algorithms (see Chapter 6) to identify multiple records belonging to the same person.

Social CRM Social media applications enable companies to engage with their customers using a variety of social media channels. For example, many companies directly react to customer enquiries on their Facebook pages or on Twitter. This allows companies to quickly react to customers' concerns and provide a level of customer service that was typically not possible in offline environments. This use of social media for customer relationship management is often referred to as social CRM . As companies are using various social media channels, customers use various social media channels to quickly share both positive and negative experiences with a product or service. Monitoring such conversations can help organizations to better measure public perceptions, and by participating in such conversations, organizations can more effectively manage customer satisfaction and maintain a positive brand image.

Social Media Monitoring Social media monitoring is the process of identifying and assessing the volume and sentiment of what is being said about a company, individual,

product, or brand. For example, monitoring online conversations can help to assess customer sentiments, find out what people really think about a product, and discover ways for improving a product; whereas most customers do not bother to fill out a survey about a product, they are likely to voice their thoughts on Facebook or Twitter if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied with a product. Similarly, many people participate in online discussion forums related to a product or company, and the company should monitor the conversation and step in when needed (e.g., when customers have questions about a product but no other customer answers within a certain time frame). To collect this information, organizations utilize a variety of tools to track and aggregate social media content from blogs, wikis, news sites, microblogs such as Twitter, social networking sites like Facebook, video- and photo-sharing websites like YouTube and Flickr, forums, message boards, blogs, and user-generated content in general. Depending on the goal of the social media monitoring program, a simple tool like Google Alerts might be adequate; alternatively, specialized applications that provide sophisticated analyses and full integration with existing CRM systems help to gain timely understanding of evolving customer sentiment. For example, Hootsuite, a popular tool for social media monitoring (and there are many), allows a company to keep track of chatter in real time on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and many others. Using such tools, companies are not only able to listen to what people are saying about their brand or products, they can also consolidate and analyze trends and other summary information to improve strategy and decision making. Many CRM systems such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM include various tools to help in monitoring and analyzing ongoing conversations on social media sites, helping to spot potential perception issues or to discover trends in customer sentiment (see Figure 8.21). Needless to say, an organization should have an appropriate social CRM strategy in place and should have clear policies, such as when to step into an online discussion, which (or how many) tweets to reply to, or how to strike a balance between grassroots marketing and deceiving people by posing as casual conversation partners.

Given the rise in importance of social media for reaching out to and communicating with customers, many organizations are creating a formal organizational group to engage in social media monitoring.

With the increasing use of social media, social media monitoring has become a central part of analyzing and understanding evolving market trends and customer sentiments. In addition, social media monitoring helps in identifying the 'influencers' who are most likely to share their views through social media. Even though social media allow anybody to voice opinions, not everyone does so. For example, while many people regularly read blogs, only a

few people write their own blogs; yet these blogs can be influential in swaying others' opinions. The importance of social media monitoring is exemplified by large companies such as Dell, which established a Social Media Listening Command Center, where a number of fulltime staff monitor more than 22,000 daily posts made about the company on various social media. Having a dedicated team helps Dell to quickly react to customer complaints or changes in public sentiment about the company, enabling near-real-time communication with the customers through social media.

COLLABORATIVE CRM. Collaborative CRM refers to systems for providing effective and efficient communication with the customer from the entire organization. Collaborative CRM systems facilitate the sharing of information across the various departments of an organization in order to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. Sharing useful customer information on a company-wide basis helps improve information quality and can be used to identify products or services a customer may be interested in. A collaborative CRM system supports customer communication and collaboration with the entire organization, thus providing more streamlined customer service with fewer handoffs. The customer engagement center (as described previously) enables customers to utilize the communication method they prefer when interacting with the organization. In other words, collaborative CRM integrates the communication related to all aspects of the marketing, sales, and support processes in order to better serve and retain customers. Collaborative CRM enhances communication in the following ways:

- ■ Greater Customer Focus. Understanding customer history and current needs helps to focus the communication on issues important to the customer.
- ■ Lower Communication Barriers. Customers are more likely to communicate with the organization when personnel have complete information and when they utilize the communication methods and preferences of the customer.
- ■ Increased Information Integration. All information about the customer as well as all prior and ongoing communication is given to all organizational personnel interacting with the customer; customers can get status updates from any organizational touch point.

In addition to these benefits, collaborative CRM environments are flexible such that they can support both routine and nonroutine events.

## Ethical Concerns with CRM

Although CRM has become a strategic enabler for developing and maintaining customer relationships, it is not viewed positively by those who feel that it invades customer privacy and facilitates coercive sales practices. Proponents of CRM warn that relying too much on the 'systems' profiles of customers, based on statistical analysis of past behavior, may categorize customers in a way that they will take exception to. Additionally, given that a goal of CRM is  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  customers  by  providing  highly personalized communication and service (such as Amazon's recommendations), at what point does the communication get too personal? It is intuitive to conclude that when customers feel that the system knows too much about them, personalization could backfire on a company. Clearly, CRM raises several ethical concerns in the digital world (see Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World,' for a comprehensive discussion of information privacy). Nevertheless, as competition continues to increase in the digital world, CRM will remain a key technology for attracting and retaining customers.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Manufacturing

Regardless of whether you're thinking about a new computer, Tv , automobile, or toy for your baby brother, most of today's consumer products have undergone an elaborate design and manufacturing process, and few companies do not make heavy use of information systems in the process. Traditionally, designers and engineers used large drawing boards to sketch detailed drawings of each component of a product. T oday, designers use computeraided design (CAd) software for this task, allowing them to create drawings faster and more accurately, thus cutting down cycle time (i.e., the time from inception to the shipment of the first product) tremendously. Further, CAd allows easier sharing of designs and can be used to produce 3d drawings of a new product. However, while you can create realistic 3d drawings of a new product, people often still prefer holding a physical model in their hands to evaluate it. 3d printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can greatly speed up the creation of prototypes as well as an increasing range of finished products. In essence, 3d printers add successive layers of material onto a surface, thus building a 3d model out of myriad individual slices. In fact, some 3d printers even use materials such as titanium, allowing battleships to produce spare parts on an as-needed basis rather than carrying warehouses full of parts. 3d printing is rapidly evolving. Another implication of 3d printing relates to where products are manufactured. In the past decades, product manufacturing was often moved to parts of the world where labor was ample and wages were low. Countries such as China, Mexico, and Taiwan have become global heavyweights, manufacturing products for Apple, nike, and countless other leading brands. 3d printing is potentially a global disrupter for manufacturing products. Many believe that the 'workers' with the lowest wages and unlimited capacity will ultimately be 3d printers, which would result in moving the manufacturing of many products close to the location of final sale. While 3d printing is not a suitable manufacturing method for all products, and it may take many years before it emerges as the dominant manufacturing method, it clearly will have global implications for employment and trade balances.

The use of technology doesn't stop there. Inventory planning, job scheduling, or warehouse management are all supported by information systems, often in the form of ERP and SCM systems. using RFId and other IoT sensors, new data can be integrated into various systems. With such highly granular data, companies will have enhanced information throughout the entire manufacturing value chain. From inventory management to production to logistics, all steps will be more transparent and efficient; complete information on the status of raw materials, production, and delivery will allow for improved inventory management, production scheduling, and delivery. once a product leaves the manufacturer, IoT will be used throughout the distribution of the product to the final customer. Clearly, information systems will continue to transform the process of designing, manufacturing, and shipping products to you.

## Key Points Review

1. Describe supply chain management systems and how they help to improve business-to-business processes. SCM focuses on improving interorganizational business processes in B2B relationships and has two main objectives: to accelerate product development and to reduce costs associated with procuring raw materials, components, and services from suppliers. Supplier and customer portals provide secure access points for established business partners. Smaller organizations often use B2B marketplaces for sourcing supplies. Organizations must match their overall supply chain strategy to their overall competitive strategy to reap the greatest benefits. SCM systems consist of supply chain planning, supply chain execution, and supply chain visibility and analytics components. Supply chain planning involves the development of various resource plans to support the efficient and effective production of goods and services. Supply chain execution involves the management of product flows, information flows, and financial flows. Supply chain visibility and analytics help in foreseeing the impacts of external events and monitoring the performance of the supply chain.
2. Describe customer relationship management systems and how they help to improve the activities involved in promoting and selling products to customers as well as providing customer service and nourishing longterm relationships. CRM is a corporate-level strategy to create and maintain lasting relationships with customers by concentrating on downstream information flows, to attract potential customers, to create customer loyalty, and to portray a positive corporate image. To develop a successful CRM strategy, organizations must make changes to policies and business processes, customer service, employee training, and data utilization. A CRM system consists of operational CRM, analytical CRM, and collaborative CRM. Operational CRM focuses on activities that deal directly with customers. Analytical CRM focuses on activities that aid managers in analyzing the sales and marketing functions as well as monitoring ongoing conversations in social media. Finally, collaborative CRM provides effective communication capabilities within the organization and externally with customers.

Net Stats: 3D Printing

3D  printing,  sometimes  called  additive  manufacturing  (AM), refers to innovative technology that utilizes processes to form (or manufacture) three-dimensional objects, models, and parts under precise  control  and  a  set  of  detailed  instructions.  It  works  by forming successive layers that add up to a complete object. This implies, in principle, that a machine can produce (or manufacture) objects of any shape, with substantial cost reduction, more delicate design, less shipping, and lower inventories.

While demand rises for certain goods and products, this revolutionary technology will allow companies to create their own products quicker and, in certain locations, even minimize complications in supply chain management and global logistics. With opportunities for reduced costs and improved product quality, increased warehouse  efficiency,  and  the  ability  to  meet  customer-specific demands, the supply chain will be the most impacted segment of the manufacturing industry if 3D printing takes off. Fortune Business Insights estimates the 3D printing market to be worth $15.2 billion in 2021 which is expected to rise to $68.71 billion by 2028.

The promise of 3D printing is to make manufacturing easy and affordable and to ease global logistics, transportation, and supply  chain  procedures.  Some  experts  think  that  3D  printing will be the next industrial revolution, and it may change visits and the total number of transactions, use the 'countif' function to count the number.)

## Database Application: Managing Customer Relations at Campus Travel

Not all frequent fliers accumulate large amounts of miles. There are many who never travel for years but have frequent-flier accounts. As manager of sales and marketing, you want to find out how to target these individuals with promotions and special offers. To accomplish this task, you will need to create the following reports:

- ■ A report displaying all frequent fliers, sorted by distance traveled
- ■ A report displaying all frequent fliers, sorted by the total amount spent on air travel

In the file InfrequentFliers.mdb, you will find travel data on the members of a frequent-flier program for the previous year. Professionally format all reports, including headers, footers, dates, and so on. (Hint: Use the report wizard to create the reports; use queries to sum up the fares and distances for each traveler before creating the respective reports.)

## CASE 1 Supply Chain Havoc

Information systems have assisted in the creation of global supply networks that allow for the worldwide procurement of raw materials and components needed as inputs into production processes. For the purpose of achieving an optimal balance between quality and costs, manufacturers often have had to rely on complicated and fragile supply chains. Imagine that you are the manufacturer of a trendy new gadget that is gaining popularity worldwide. Also, imagine that a tsunami just rolled over the factory of a key manufacturer of a certain critical component in your device. At best, you may encounter long shipment delays and lost sales; at worst, your opportunity in the marketplace fades and you go out of business. Thus, shielding the delicate supply chain from negative impacts arising from external events is a tremendous challenge for many organizations, especially in a reality where disruptions can rarely be forecast and the results can be devastating.

factor influencing the efficiency and effectiveness of a global supply chain. The BSI estimated that hijacking had become the most common type of cargo crime, jumping from 17 percent of incidents in 2018 to 26 percent in 2019. Incidences in some countries are quite violent for those involved in the supply chain. For example, truck drivers in Central and South America are often kidnapped to delay law enforcement intervention. Further, approximately 28 percent of stolen cargo is food, which usually cannot be recovered because the supply chain can no longer guarantee the safety of the product.

There are a variety of events that can put a supply chain in havoc. In addition to extreme weather events and global pandemics, other events such as cargo crime and terrorism  can  lead  to  disruptions.  For instance, the British Standards Institution (BSI) estimated that median loss per incident in 2019 was as much as US$100,000 with total global losses in the tens of billions US dollars in extra costs from these incidents and other factors.

While it's not something most people think about, cargo crime is a significant

Terrorism is also increasingly wreaking havoc on supply chains. In particular, lonewolf terrorism has emerged as a prominent threat to supply chains. Germany suffered a devastating lone-wolf attack in October 2019 where an individual hijacked a truck in Limburg-an-der-Lahn and drove it into a line of cars and innocent bystanders, killing eight. Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from the greatest frequency of terror attacks, representing 30 percent of global incidences. Often these attacks are focused on infrastructure such as roads and bridges, significantly disrupting supply chains in the region.

Other incidents are even more unexpected, such as the devastating impacts of the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  that infected millions of people across the world. By  February  2020,  the  pandemic  had reduced shipping volume of boats leaving China to less than 10 percent of the usual capacity. Besides the drop in shipping volume, approximately 25 percent of the ship operators were forced to cancel their sailings completely, as the fuel costs outweighed the revenues gained from transporting goods on an empty vessel. It is important to note that these estimates include only the goods that actually made it to the shipping ports, as many Chinese factories were unable to transport their finished goods because of a massive shortage of operating trucks.

Often highlighted for disrupting supply chains, natural disasters and extreme weather also were significant disrupters. In 2019, natural disasters disrupting supply chains included flooding in Southeast Asia, cyclones in India, fires in California and Australia, and typhoons in Japan, to name a few.

Lastly, social unrest in many developing countries can lead to additional supply chain losses. More than 24 percent of countries in the world experienced protest and civil unrest in 2019, and that percentage is expected to grow to nearly 40 percent of countries in 2020. Other threats that might play a role in future disruptions include infectious diseases such as COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola. Concerns with climate change and El Niño may also result in increased extreme weather events. Clearly, many factors  can  create  supply  chain havoc. And because it is impossible to elude disruptions within today's global supply networks, organizations must carefully plan for disasters because they simply cannot be avoided..

## CASE 2 Efficiently Delivering Products over the 'Last Mile'

In the delivery business, the industry is aggressively working to improve the efficiency of the 'last mile,' which reflects the delivery of a product to the end consumer. Such delivery historically has been performed by a postal service or package delivery company like UPS, FedEx, or DHL. With the growth of e-commerce, there has been a huge reduction in traditional shopping where customers visit a physical store, purchase products, and then carry those products home. Likewise, with the rapid growth of e-commerce, the last mile of delivery has grown in importance. Delivering a 5-pound package for same-day delivery within the same city using a traditional delivery method costs anywhere from US$5 to US$13. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, the delivery costs are free for most products with some exceptions for minimum order amounts or upcharges for a faster shipping speed. When shipping  costs  are  added  onto lower-priced products, expedited delivery becomes uneconomical for many customers. Thus, creating ways to deliver products fast and cheaply to the end consumers can provide an incredible competitive advantage.

companies are exploring UAVs for product delivery, including Google, USPS, DHL, and many others as well as many governments around the world.

With such high stakes in mind, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos announced plans for Amazon Prime Air (APA) in late 2013. APA's plan is to use small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, commonly known as drones) to transport packages to customers. The goal is to deliver packages in under 30 minutes for locations within 10 miles of a warehouse. Not all items will be suitable for APA delivery, however, as they must be small enough to fit within the cargo box of the UAV and cannot exceed a weight of 5 pounds (which applies to 85 percent  of  Amazon's  packages).  The biggest hurdle for getting APA off the ground was not a technical problem but regulations concerning the use of UAVs for commercial delivery. While the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted Amazon permission to begin testing prototypes of the delivery vehicle, the approval for making widespread deliveries has not yet been finalized. During testing, APA's flights were limited to a maximum height of 400 feet and a speed of 100 mph. The UAV planned for use by Amazon is 55 pounds in weight and flies at speeds up to 55 mph. From an economic perspective, the last mile is often the most expensive when you consider the total costs of the vehicle, fuel, and driver. So if Amazon offered 30-minute delivery using a UAV, it  would  significantly  undercut  other options for same-day delivery, further strengthening its online dominance. Needless to say, given the importance of solving t h e   l a s t   mile  problem,  many  other

In addition to UAV delivery, there is tremendous innovation occurring around ground-based autonomous delivery. In February 2016, for example, Google was granted a U.S. patent for an autonomous delivery truck. Google plans to leverage its driverless vehicle technology, delivering anything from online purchases to your Saturday night pizza. Google emphasized the importance of the last mile problem in its patent application, stating that the 'two largest delivery services in the U.S.  operate  over  100,000  last  mile vehicles-each of which requires a human operator.' Google is not the only one thinking of autonomous delivery. In early 2016, Domino's built and tested an autonomous pizza delivery robot in Australia. When the delivery arrives at a customer's door, the customer needs to enter a mobile code to open the vehicle's insulated storage area, which can keep items either hot or cold. Even the U.S.-based pharmacy CVS partnered with UPS in late 2019 to make drone deliveries. While e-commerce has transformed how most of us shop for goods and services, UAVs and autonomous delivery will further transform the digital world.
