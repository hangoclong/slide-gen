## Securing Information Systems

## Preview

With  the  proliferation  of  computing  technologies  in every corner of the world, most people and organizations  have  become  completely  dependent  upon  their smartphones, tablets, or other information systems (IS) to  support  communication  and  commerce.  With  this increasing  dependency  on  technology  to  work  flawlessly,  we  have  never  been  more  vulnerable  to  catastrophic security disasters.  Because of this,  individuals and organizations are focusing more of their attention on   information systems security. Here, we first examine  computer  crime  and  other  threats  to  information systems  security,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  various approaches for  securing  information  systems  and  the critical data they hold.

Managing in the digital world requires careful attention to IS security. Having thorough plans and approaches for dealing with IS security attacks and natural disasters is critical for effectively managing IS resources within organizations and your personal life.

## MANAGING IN THE DIGITAL WORLD:

## Not So 'Anonymous'Activists, Hacktivists, or Just Plain Criminals?

F ile-sharing sites like Megaupload.com, best known for  its  massive  size  and  volume  of  downloaded content, are hotbeds of online piracy. After being shut down by U.S. authorities, Megaupload.com formally bade goodbye in 2012 as New Zealand police raided several homes and businesses linked to its founder Kim Dotcom (a name he took on after making a fortune during the dotcom bubble). With only a slight warning from a tweet reading, 'One thing is certain: EXPECT US!' a hacktivist  group  called  Anonymous  launched  'Operation Payback' (Figure 10.1); utilizing 5,635 zombie computers distributed throughout the internet, Anonymous delivered  a  retaliatory  attack  resulting  in  a  string  of highly coordinated takedowns of websites managed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of other organizations  that  have  publicly  supported  anti-piracy legislation, including the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, and Universal Music.

Who is Anonymous? Having no formal organization and no formal leadership, Anonymous is often considered to be a loose collective of hacktivists-internet users practicing  civil  disobedience  by  taking  part  in  cyberattacks on websites. The group has participated in several cyberattacks;  the  best  known  concerned  a  vigilante

After reading this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

1.  Define computer crime and describe several types of computer crime.
2.  Describe and explain differences between cyberwar and cyberterrorism.
3.  Discuss the process of managing IS security and describe various IS controls that can help in ensuring IS security.

pornography. In 2012, Anonymous members defended a teen victim of cyberbullying. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and massive tornado damage in Oklahoma in 2013, Anonymous mobilized its online influence to support relief efforts. These efforts  were  considered  by  many  to  be  more  effective than  those  of  government  relief  agencies.  Although Anonymous claims to have good intentions, what the group does is sometimes illegal, and Anonymous and its supporters face a dilemma of having to choose between  pursuing  (sometimes  worthwhile)  ideological goals and crossing the boundaries of legality.

movement against Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal as a protest for their freezing the accounts of the whistleblower site WikiLeaks. Anonymous is also politically active, launching attacks on Israeli government websites in response to Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip. In  late  2015,  Anonymous  launched  sustained  operations against the ISIS terrorist group in retaliation for the Paris attacks that killed more than 100 people. In early 2016, Anonymous targeted the U.S. presidential campaign of Donald Trump for his 'hateful campaign.' In  early  2020,  Anonymous  continued  their  political hacktivism by creating a page for Taiwan on the United Nations' website.

Not all Anonymous's actions are controversial. Anonymous garnered much public sympathy with the 2011 'Operation Darknet,' its attempt to battle child

After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer the following:

1. What is the difference between hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and other computer criminals?
2. What tools can hacktivists and other computer criminals use to conduct cyberwar or cyberterrorist attacks?
3. How can organizations and individuals protect themselves from attacks by hacktivists and other computer criminals?

## Computer Crime

We continue to hear and read about cases where a breach of computer security was catastrophic and/or had potentially dire consequences. For example, in 2020, cybercriminals accessed user account data of 300,000 Nintendo Switch users, account data of over 8 million users of the meal delivery service Home Chef, travel data of 9 million passengers of the budget airline EasyJet, and massive amounts of other data from countless organizations, ranging from hospitals such as University of Missouri Health to auto manufacturer Honda, whose computers were held by ransomware. It seems like there is an announcement of a major cyberattack or data breach virtually every week, and researchers predicted that in 2020 more than 5 billion records would be impacted in the United States (U.S.) alone, exceeding the figures from 2019. It is becoming clear that no one is immune from computer crime and that information systems security strategies are often lacking. As computer criminals won't become complacent anytime soon, organizations need to guard against attacks. Computer crime is defined as the use of a computer to commit an illegal act. This broad definition of computer crime includes the following:

- ■ Targeting a computer while committing an offense. For example, someone gains unauthorized entry to a computer system to cause damage to the computer system or to the data it contains.
- ■ Using a computer to commit an offense. In such cases, computer criminals may steal credit card numbers from websites or a company's database, skim money from bank accounts, or make unauthorized electronic fund transfers from financial institutions.
- ■ Using computers to support a criminal activity even though computers are not actually targeted. For example, drug dealers and other professional criminals may use computers to store records of their illegal transactions or use wire transfers for the purpose of electronic money laundering, an increasingly popular type of computer crime.

The global economic impact of computer crime and cyber-espionage was estimated to be about US$1.3 trillion, with US$2.9 million lost every minute due to cybercrime. While this is a fraction of the estimated US$142 trillion global gross domestic product (GDP), its greater impact is its effect on trade, technology development, and competitiveness. Additionally, as many cyberattacks are so visible to customers and investors through 24-hour global news reporting, reports of an attack on a company can have a tremendously negatively effect on the company's valuation and stock price, and many organizations do not report incidents of computer crime because of fear that negative publicity could hurt stock value or provide advantages to competitors. Thus, experts believe that many incidents are never reported and that real losses exceed these estimates. It is clear, however, that computer crime is a fact of life, and for organizations, computer crime has become a strategic and board of directors-level issue, with more than half of the more than 500 U.S. respondents to the 2018 U.S. State of Cybercrime Survey feeling that C-level executives were in most need of security awareness training. In this section, we briefly introduce this topic of growing importance.

## Hacking and Cracking

Those individuals who are knowledgeable enough to gain access to computer systems without authorization have long been referred to as hackers . The name was first used in the 1960s to describe expert computer users and programmers who were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Based on curiosity and the desire to learn as much as possible about computers, they wrote programs for the mainframes they used that allowed them to roam freely through computer systems and freely exchanged information about their 'hacks'; however, they followed unwritten rules against damaging or stealing data belonging to others.

As computer crime became more prevalent and damaging, true hackers-those motivated by curiosity and not by a desire to do harm (sometimes referred to as 'white hats')-objected to use of the term to describe computer criminals (Figure 10.2). Among other things, white hats attempt to discover critical software bugs in software, often in the hope of earning considerable bug bounties offered by companies such as Apple, Google, or Tesla. Today, those who break into computer systems with the intention of doing damage or committing a crime are usually called crackers or 'black hats.' Some computer criminals attempt to break into systems or deface websites to promote political or ideological goals (e.g., free speech, human rights, and antiwar campaigns); these web vandals are referred to as hacktivists .

## Types of Computer Criminals and Crimes

Computer crimes are almost as varied as the users who commit them. Some involve the use of a computer to steal money or other assets or to perpetrate a deception for money, such as advertising merchandise for sale on a web auction site, collecting orders and payment, and then sending either inferior merchandise or no merchandise at all. Other computer crimes involve stealing or altering data. Some of those thieves who steal data or disrupt a computer system have demanded a ransom from victims in exchange for returning the data or repairing the damage. Cyberterrorists have planted destructive programs in computer systems and then threatened to activate them if a ransom is not paid (see the upcoming discussion on cyberterrorism). Crimes in the form of electronic vandalism cause damage when offenders plant viruses, cause computer systems to crash, or deny service on a website.

Another type of crime that increasingly is using computers is industrial espionage. Industrial espionage describes covert activities, such as the theft of trade secrets, bribery, blackmail, and technological surveillance to gain an advantage over rivals. Many notable companies have been victims of industrial espionage, including Procter &amp; Gamble, IBM, DuPont, Gillette, Kodak, Starwood, and Microsoft. Industrial espionage is most commonly associated with technology-heavy industries, such as the computer hardware and software industries, but also with any other industry in which a significant amount of money is spent on research and development, such as the defense, automobile, and pharmaceutical industries. Often, competitors attempt to steal prototypes to gain access to new technological developments. Industrial espionage is also often carried out by compromising someone who works for a targeted company through bribery, coercion, or blackmail. Increasingly, industrial espionage targets an organization's supply chain partners, whose systems might be easier to exploit. Whereas industrial espionage tended to be conducted primarily by rival companies, it is increasingly committed (or at least supported) by nation states to obtain high-value intellectual property.

The proliferation of the internet and mobile devices is providing additional avenues for industrial espionage. Cracking into a company's computer system has become a fairly common practice, where criminals steal confidential data and trade secrets that could be sold to others. Laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives can be stolen or accessed while left unattended in hotel rooms or can be stolen while in transit (e.g., stolen out of checked baggage when traveling). In the digital world, critical data is always vulnerable to attacks, and the loss of strategic data may give an organization's rivals a competitive advantage and can have devastating impacts on the company's bottom line.

Use of the internet has fostered other types of criminal activity, such as the stalking of minors by sexual predators through newsgroups and chat rooms.

WHO COMMITS COMPUTER CRIMES? When you hear the term cracker or computer criminal , you might imagine a techno-geek, someone who sits in front of his or her computer all day and night, attempting to break the ultra-super-secret security code of one of the most sophisticated

## FIGURE 10.2

Malicious hackers are referred to as black hats, and those not motivated to do harm are referred to as white hats.

computer systems in the world, perhaps a computer for the U.S. military, a Swiss bank, or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). While this fits the traditional profile for a computer criminal, there is no clear profile today. More and more people have the skills, the tools, and the motives to hack into a computer system. A modern-day computer criminal could be a disgruntled, middleaged, white-collar worker sitting at a nice desk on the 14th floor of the headquarters building of a billion-dollar software manufacturer. Computer criminals have been around for decades. For the most part, we associate hackers and crackers with their pranks and crimes involving computer break-ins, virus distribution, and other malicious acts. Nevertheless, hackers and crackers have caused the loss of billions of dollars' worth of stolen goods, repair bills, and lost goodwill with customers.

Studies attempting to categorize computer criminals show that they generally fall into one of four groups. These groups are listed next, from those who commit the most infractions to those who commit the fewest infractions:

1. Current or former employees who are able to steal or otherwise do damage to employers; most organizations report insider abuses as their most common crime
2. People with technical knowledge who commit business or information sabotage for personal gain
3. Career criminals who use computers to assist in crimes
4. Outside crackers simply snooping or hoping to find data of value-crackers commit millions of intrusions per year, but most cause no harm (Estimates are that only about 10 percent of cracker attacks cause damage.)

Some crackers probe others' computer systems, electronically stored data, or websites for fun, for curiosity, or just to prove they can. Others have malicious or financial motives and intend to steal for gain or do other harm. Whatever the motives, discovery, prosecution, fines, and jail terms can result.

How do computer criminals gain access to computer systems? Frequently, computer criminals use sophisticated software such as vulnerability scanners to automatically test targeted systems for weaknesses; packet sniffers to analyze network traffic and capture unencrypted passwords; keyloggers to capture every keystroke and thus gather data such as email addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers; or tools to break passwords using a brute-force approach (note that vulnerability scanners and packet sniffers can also be used by organizations to test the effectiveness of controls, and keyloggers may be installed on companies' computers to monitor employees; see the upcoming discussion of IS controls). Alternatively, crackers try to exploit human weaknesses by using methods such as phishing attacks (to be discussed), social engineering (misrepresenting oneself to trick others into revealing information), shoulder surfing (looking over someone's shoulder while the person is keying in access credentials), or dumpster diving (scouring wastebaskets for potentially useful information).

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. Unauthorized access occurs whenever people who are not authorized to see, manipulate, or otherwise handle data search systems for interesting or useful data, peek at monitors displaying proprietary or confidential data, or intercept electronic messages on the way to their destination. Unauthorized access can include seemingly unproblematic actions such as an employee stealing time on company computers to do personal business, but also attackers hacking into people's social media accounts, thieves stealing credit card numbers and Social Security numbers from electronic databases and then using the stolen information to charge thousands of dollars in merchandise to victims, or competitors' employees posing as interns to steal proprietary information about products or corporate strategies (i.e., engaging in industrial espionage). Increasingly, computer criminals access victims' computers for eavesdropping and surveillance, such as by remotely enabling and monitoring a laptop's webcam to obtain sensitive information.

When electronic data are shared by several users, as in an organization, in-house system administrators can prevent casual snooping or theft of data by requiring correct permissions. Further, administrators can log attempts of unauthorized individuals trying to obtain access. Determined attackers, however, will try to gain access by giving themselves system administrator status or otherwise elevating their permission level-sometimes by stealing

<!-- image -->

passwords and logging on to a system as authorized users (Figure 10.3). Today, malicious insiders , referred to as insider threats, are a top concern for government and corporate agencies.

The term insider threats refers to 'trusted adversaries' or 'malicious insiders' who operate within an organization's boundaries and are a significant danger to both private and public sectors. Insider threats include disgruntled employees or ex-employees, potential employees, contractors, business partners, or auditors. The damage caused by an insider threat can take many forms, including workplace violence; the introduction of malware into corporate networks; the theft of data, corporate secrets, or money; the corruption or deletion of data; and so on. Especially in very large organizations, identifying insider threats can be extremely difficult. For instance, identifying a small number of potential insider threats within an organization with thousands of employees is a 'needle in the haystack' problem. In fact, in January 2014, James R. Clapper, director of National Intelligence, cited the malicious insider as the greatest threat to the United States, exceeding terrorism.

The most famous insider threat in recent history is Edward Snowden, an American computer professional who once worked for the CIA and was a contract worker for the National Security Agency (NSA). He came to international attention when he disclosed thousands of classified documents-which he had acquired while working for the American consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton-to several media outlets. Similarly, the whistleblower site Wikileaks frequently publishes information (mostly related to political relations) obtained from insiders. Insider threats may also take the form of backdoors (i.e., hidden access points allowing for unauthorized access), which are (intentionally or unintentionally) built into systems by software developers. Such backdoors might be exploited by malicious crackers, intelligence agencies, or one's competitors (for industrial espionage). An unintended backdoor is often referred to as a zero-day vulnerability. A zero-day is an undisclosed hardware or software vulnerability that crackers can exploit to adversely affect computer programs, data, other computers, or networks. Such vulnerabilities are referred to as a 'zero-day' because once the flaw becomes known, the hardware or software vendor has zero days to mitigate the flaw.

UNAUTHORIZED DATA MODIFICATION. Often related to unauthorized access, unauthorized data modification occurs when someone accesses electronic data and then changes it in some way, such as when crackers hack into government websites and change content or when employees give themselves electronic raises and bonuses (Figure 10.4).

## FIGURE 10.3

Unauthorized access can occur in many ways.

OTHER THREATS TO IS SECURITY. Many times, IS security is breached simply because organizations and individuals do not exercise proper care in safeguarding information systems. Some examples follow:

- ■ Employees keep passwords or access codes on slips of paper in plain sight.
- ■ Individuals have never bothered to install antivirus software, or they install the software but fail to keep it up to date.

## GREEN IT

## Power Efficiency and Prioritization of Cloud Services

Moving enterprise software and infrastructure to the cloud provides many benefits such as ease of deployment, utility computing, high performance, agility, security, and streamlined software licensing, among others. In addition to these more commonly discussed benefits, two others that are often less discussed include efficient power usage and prioritization of services. Cloud-based datacenters require massive amounts of power, and the energy required to operate them has risen by 6 percent since 2010, amounting to 1 percent of the overall energy used in 2018. During the same time period, computing power in datacenters increased by 550 percent, illustrating the growth of datacenter use in conjunction with improvements in power efficiency of installed hardware resources. further, major cloud providers such as google and Amazon are committed to using sustainable sources to provide computing power, and research has shown that moving from locally installed datacenters to cloud-based providers can reduce carbon output by 72 percent on average.

Where power efficiency and prioritization of services become quite interesting is when we consider how cloud providers shift their computing capacity to meet demand, by optimizing the power used and the product delivered to the consumer. for example, consider a case where solar and wind energy provides power to a datacenter. Solar produces energy during the day in conjunction with sunlight, and wind power can fluctuate depending on the weather. Cloud providers can accordingly prioritize computing power by ramping up or ramping down time-insensitive tasks, thereby using energy efficiently in what google calls carbon-intelligent computing. Additionally, in times of extreme demand, cloud providers prioritize computing power to high-priority tasks such as providing services to healthcare workers during the CoVID-19 pandemic, while slowing those computing tasks deemed less urgent.

- ■ Computer users within an organization continue to use default network passwords after a network is set up instead of passwords that are more difficult to break.
- ■ Employees are careless about letting outsiders view computer monitors, or they carelessly give out information over the telephone.
- ■ Organizations fail to limit access to company files and system resources.
- ■ Organizations fail to install effective firewalls or intrusion detection systems, or they install an intrusion detection system but fail to monitor it regularly.
- ■ Organizations fail to conduct proper background checks on new hires.
- ■ Fired employees are resentful and install harmful code, such as computer viruses, when they leave the company.

With the increasing popularity of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, many additional security threats have emerged, including:

- ■ Individuals lose their mobile devices and don't have capabilities to remotely wipe data from the device.
- ■ Individuals keep sensitive data on mobile devices and do not use passcodes.
- ■ Individuals 'jailbreak' their mobile phone. Jailbreaking -that is, modifying the operating system to remove manufacturer or carrier restrictions to run applications other than those from the official app store-can allow unsecure applications to run on devices or make it difficult to upgrade devices that have been modified.
- ■ Individuals use poorly designed mobile applications that can have security vulnerabilities.
- ■ Individuals use unsecure wireless networks, leaving their devices vulnerable to different types of attacks.

While there are many threats to IS security, there are also ways to combat those threats. Later, we discuss safeguards organizations can use to improve IS security.

## Computer Viruses and Other Destructive Code

Malware -short for 'malicious software' such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses-continues to have a tremendous economic impact on the world, costing organizations on average more than US$2.6 million in terms of disrupted business, lost information and revenue, and damaged equipment (Bissell, LaSalle, and Dal Cin, 2019). Accurate estimates of real costs to organizations and society are difficult to obtain, as many organizations choose not to report major incidents; most organizations do not want to alarm customers and shareholders of malware and other security breaches. Increasingly, malware targets not only traditional computers, but Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well.

COMPUTER VIRUSES. A virus is a destructive program that disrupts the normal functioning of information systems. Viruses differ from other types of malicious code in that they can reproduce themselves. Some viruses are intended to be harmless pranks, but more often they do damage to a computer system by erasing files on the hard drive or by slowing computer processing or otherwise compromising the system. Viruses infect a single computer only, potentially spreading to other computers if infected files are shared. Viruses are planted in host computers in several different ways (Figure 10.5), but are most often spread through malicious email attachments, the sharing of removable media (such as USB sticks), or file downloads from malicious websites.

WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, AND OTHER SINISTER PROGRAMS. Viruses are among the most virulent forms of computer infections, but other destructive code can also be damaging. A worm -a variation of a virus that is targeted at networks-is designed to spread by itself without the need for an infected host file to be shared. Worms take advantage of security holes in operating systems and other software to replicate endlessly across the internet, thus causing servers to crash, which denies service to internet users.

Another category of destructive programs is called Trojan horses . Like the Trojan horse in Greek mythology, Trojan horses appear to be legitimate, benign programs but carry a destructive payload. Unlike viruses, Trojan horses typically do not replicate themselves but, like viruses, can do much damage, such as by giving the creator unauthorized access to a system. When a Trojan horse is planted in a computer, its instructions remain hidden. The computer appears to function normally, but in fact it is performing underlying functions dictated by the intrusive code. For example, under the pretext of playing chess with an unsuspecting systems operator, a cracker

## FIGURE 10.5

How a computer virus is spread.

<!-- image -->

group installed a Trojan horse in a Canadian mainframe. While the game appeared to be proceeding normally, the Trojan horse program was sneakily establishing a powerful administrator account for the future use of the intruders.

Logic bombs or time bombs are variations of Trojan horses. They also do not reproduce themselves and are designed to operate without disrupting normal computer function. Instead, they lie in wait for unsuspecting computer users to perform a triggering operation. Logic bombs are set off by certain types of operations, such as entering a specific password or adding or deleting names and other data to and from certain databases. Time bombs are set off by specific dates, such as the birthday of a famous person. Disgruntled employees have planted logic and time bombs on being fired, intending for the program to activate after they have left the company. In at least one instance in recent history, a former employee in Minnesota demanded money to deactivate the time bomb he had planted in company computers before it destroyed employee payroll records.

Recently, a new type of malware called ransomware has emerged. In 2019, Accenture reported that the frequency of ransomware attacks has tripled over the period of two years. Ransomware holds a user's computer hostage by locking or taking control of the user's computer or encrypting files or documents. Once infected, the scammers demand a ransom to be paid by a certain deadline to unlock the computers or decrypt the files. Alternatively, an official-looking message from a law enforcement agency (typically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI]) is displayed (complete with logos) that demands the payment of a fine to avoid being prosecuted for illegal activity/content detected on the computer. In either case, paying the ransom does not guarantee getting access to the files again, and having backups is the best safeguard against ransomware (see the upcoming discussion about controls).

DENIAL OF SERVICE. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks occur when electronic intruders deliberately attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service (e.g., customers accessing a website) from using that service, often by using up all of a system's resources. To execute such attacks, intruders often create armies of zombie computers by infecting computers that are in homes, schools, and businesses with viruses or worms. Any computer connected to the internet can be infected if it is not protected by firewalls and antivirus software and is, therefore, open to attacks and to being used as a zombie computer (in fact, some security experts believe that more than 10 percent of all computers connected to the internet are used as zombies, unbeknownst to the owners). The zombie computers, without users' knowledge or consent, are used to spread the malware to other computers and to launch attacks on their targets. Such DoS attacks that use a large number of computers to perform the attack are typically referred to as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks ; DDoS attacks

<!-- image -->

are difficult to counter, as it is difficult to distinguish malicious traffic from legitimate user traffic. The computers under attack crash under the barrage of bogus computer-generated visitors, causing a denial of service to legitimate users (Figure 10.6). For example, in late 2016, the Mirai botnet used millions of IoT devices (such as internet-connected CCTV cameras) to attack the DNS system, a critical part of the internet infrastructure responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses (see the Technology Briefing). As a result, large parts of the United States experienced internet blackouts, with major sites from Twitter to PayPal being unreachable for hours at a time. The rise of cloud computing has further facilitated DDoS attacks; just as organizations use cloud computing to benefit from simplified hosting, cost advantages, and scalability, computer criminals have turned to cloud computing to launch attacks. DDoS attacks have become prevalent, with security researchers estimating that 16 DDoS attacks take place every minute, with the most powerful having data rates of 622 Gbps.

SPYWARE, SPAM, AND COOKIES. Three additional ways in which information systems can be threatened are by spyware, spam, and cookies.

Spyware Spyware is any software that covertly gathers data about a user through an internet connection without the user's knowledge. Spyware is sometimes hidden within freeware or shareware programs. In other instances, it is embedded within a website and is downloaded to the user's computer, without the user's knowledge, to track data about the user for marketing and advertisement purposes. Spyware can monitor your activity (such as website visits) and secretly transmit that data to someone else or may include keyloggers that capture sensitive data as it is typed. Spyware presents problems because it uses your computer's memory resources; eats network bandwidth as it sends data back to the spyware's home base via your internet connection; causes system instability or, worse, system crashes; and exposes users to identity theft, credit card fraud, and other types of crime. Adware (free software paid for by advertisements appearing during the use of the software) sometimes contains spyware that collects data about a person's web surfing behavior to customize website banner advertisements. It is important to note that spyware is not currently illegal, although there is ongoing legislative hype about regulating it in some way. Fortunately, firewalls and spyware protection software can be used to scan for and block spyware.

Spam Another prevalent form of network traffic that invades our email is spam. Spam is electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings, usually for the purpose of advertising for some product and/or service (Figure 10.7). In addition to being a nuisance and wasting our time, spam also eats up huge amounts of storage space and network bandwidth, with more than 50 percent of all email in early 2020 being spam! While many consider marketing emails as spam, malicious spammers commonly use zombie computers to send out millions of email messages, unbeknownst to the computer users. Some spam consists of hoaxes, asking you to donate money to nonexistent causes or warning you of viruses and other internet dangers that do not exist. Other times, spam includes attachments that carry destructive computer viruses. As a result, internet service providers and those who manage email within organizations often use spam filters to fight spam. Typical spam filters use multiple defense layers-consisting of dedicated hardware and software-to help reduce the amount of spam processed by the central email servers and delivered to users' inboxes. Using techniques such as sophisticated machine learning algorithms (see Chapter 6, 'Enhancing Business Intelligence Using Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence'), spam filters have gotten better over the years, and fight not only spam but also other email threats, such as directory harvest attacks (i.e., attempts to determine valid email addresses for building spam databases), phishing attacks (discussed below), viruses, and more. Increasingly, spammers use instant messaging, cell phone text messaging (SMS), or other messaging services (such as WhatsApp) to spread their annoying (and sometimes malicious) messages.

In addition to advertisement, computer criminals use spam emails to spread hoaxes, encouraging the recipients to forward them to their friends. An internet hoax is a false message circulated online about new viruses, funds for alleged victims of a global catastrophe, kids in trouble, cancer causes and cures, or any other topic of public interest. In most cases, the consequences of passing on a hoax will be small, and your friends will just ridicule you; in other cases, spammers use such hoaxes to 'harvest' email addresses to identify future targets. Several websites, such as Snopes (https://www.snopes.com), Symantec, and McAfee, publish lists of known hoaxes, and you should always check to see if a message is a hoax before you forward it to others.

In its worst form, spam is used for phishing (or spoofing), which refers to attempts to trick financial account and credit card holders into giving away their authentication credentials, usually by sending spam messages to millions of email accounts (i.e., attackers are 'phishing' [fishing] for victims). These phony messages contain links to websites that duplicate legitimate sites to capture login credentials. For example, most email users regularly receive phishing attempts from Gmail, eBay, PayPal, various spoofed banks, or fake system administrators (Figure 10.8). As people learn that generically addressed email from a bank is not likely legitimate, criminals have turned to spear phishing. Spear phishing is a more sophisticated fraudulent email attack that

<!-- image -->

targets a specific person or organization by personalizing the message (phishing with a spear rather than a broad net) to make the message appear as if it is from a trusted source such as an individual within the recipient's company (often someone in a position of authority), a government entity, or a well-known company. While spear phishing can be very effective, the attacker needs some basic information to optimally target the phishing message. Many fear that social media sites like Facebook will increasingly provide valuable information about potential victims to criminals designing spear phishing attacks. Relatedly, computer criminals can use user account data for sales and investment fraud by posing as investment brokers and then luring the victim into investing into dubious opportunities.

Often, spammers post their spam messages in online forums, blogs, or wikis or create thousands of email accounts at free providers such as Yahoo! Or Outlook.com to send out their messages. Rather than manually going through such tedious tasks to set up these accounts or post thousands of messages, spammers use bots (i.e., software robots that work in the background to provide services to their owners; see Chapter 6) to do this. Faced with this problem, email providers and managers of online forums are attempting to prevent spammers from using bots to automatically submit online forms. One commonly used approach for preventing bots from submitting forms is the use of CAPTCHAs. A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) typically consists of a distorted image displaying a combination of letters and/or numbers that a user has to input into a form (in addition to other required information) before submitting it (Figure 10.9). As the image is distorted, (currently) only humans can interpret the letters/numbers, preventing the use of automated bots for creating accounts or posting spam to forums, blogs, or wikis. CAPTCHAs are also used to prevent crackers from trying to break passwords using a brute force approach , where a bot submits thousands or millions of possible passwords (usually from a list of common passwords) until the correct password is found.

However, trying to stop spammers is a cat-and-mouse game, and increasingly, webmasters are using a combination of multiple techniques to stop spammers, such as detecting mouse movements (as automated agents do not use a mouse), detecting the rate at which text is entered into forms, or incorporating invisible fields (which would be 'seen' and filled out by an automated agent but not a human user) together with CAPTCHAs to distinguish between   malicious bots and legitimate users.

Cookies Another potential nuisance in internet usage is cookies. A cookie is a small text file passed to a web browser on a user's computer by a web server. The browser then stores the message in a text file, and the message is sent back to the server each time the user's browser requests a page from that server.

Cookies are normally used for legitimate purposes, such as identifying a user to present a customized web page or for authentication purposes. Although you can choose to not accept the storage of cookies, you may not be able to visit the site, or it may not function properly. For example, to read the New York Times online, you must register by entering your name and other information. When you go through the registration process, cookies are stored on your machine. If you don't accept cookies or you delete the stored cookies, you are not allowed to access the online newspaper without reregistering. Similarly, you will have to accept cookies when purchasing from many e-tailers, as most online shopping carts require cookies to function properly. In some cases, cookies may contain sensitive data (such as credit card numbers) and thus pose a security risk in case unauthorized persons gain access to the computer. Many countries as well as the European Union now require websites to inform users about the use of cookies. The increasingly frequent consent management pop-ups regarding cookies when you visit a new website are a result of companies trying to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Specific cookie management or cookie killer software can be used to manage cookies, but an even simpler way to manage cookies is through the settings in your web browser. In the settings for the Firefox web browser, for example, you can set levels of restrictions on the use of cookies, you can block them altogether, and, if you do allow them, you can go in periodically and delete them from your computer.

THE RISE OF BOTNETS AND THE CYBERATTACK SUPPLY CHAIN. Destructive software robots, called bots (see Chapter 6), working together on a collection of zombie computers via the internet, called botnets , have become the standard method of operation for professional cybercriminals. For example, about 85 percent of all email spam is sent out by only six major botnets. Attacks using botnets are utilizing a global supply chain of highly specialized criminals. For instance, a phishing attack can involve the following:

1. A programmer writes a phishing attack template and makes this available for purchase.
2. A phisher who wants to run an attack purchases the template and designs an attack (e.g., ask recipients of a spam email to update their login credentials at the Wells Fargo Bank).
3. The phisher contracts with a cracker to provide hosting space for the phishing websites.
4. The phisher contacts a bot herder -a criminal who has a botnet residing on a collection of zombie computers-to send out the spam email that carries the attack to unsuspecting people.

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

## The Bug That Almost Killed the Internet

on December 31, 2011, Stephen Henson reviewed a new section of code for inclusion into the openSSL Project. openSSL is a popular encryption framework used to secure many internet-based transactions. Dr. Henson, one of the core developers of the software, apparently failed to notice a flaw in the code, and the bug was adopted into widespread use across the internet, where it remained undetected for more than 2 years. When a fix for the flaw was completed in April 2014, an estimated 17 percent (about half a million) of web servers were believed to have been vulnerable to attack. Forbes magazine labeled the bug the worst since commercial traffic began to flow on the internet.

systems, leading to potential repercussions for thousands of companies and their users.

Heartbleed serves as a cogent reminder of the potential dangers associated with conducting transactions via the internet. It should however be noted that good came from the bug. Researchers at google created Project Zero, a team dedicated to finding and disclosing exploits for not only google's software, but for software created by other companies as well. Their work has led to many important discoveries-and prompted security fixes-for companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and LastPass.

## Based on:

The security bug-popularly known as Heartbleedallowed an attacker to read the active memory of systems with the vulnerability. The bug compromised various types of potentially sensitive data, including encryption keys, usernames and passwords, and the actual data that those encryption and authentication technologies were intended to protect. Though many companies were quick to update their server software, it was reported that the vast majority of large organizations had yet to fully remediate the security bug one year after the fix was released (early 2015); two years after the fix was released (early 2016), Heartbleed was still affecting web server security as the original bug was appearing in new variations. Even by early 2020, the vulnerability continued to persist in companies that were either unable or unwilling to patch their

5. After launching the attack and collecting data from those who responded to the phishing attack, the phisher provides the stolen credentials to a collector who specializes in removing funds from the affected financial institutions.
6. The collector works with a criminal called a mule herder who has a network of people (called mules ) who carry out the withdrawals from affected banks.

Each member of the supply chain has very specialized skills and can be located anywhere in the world. In fact, one of the difficulties in stopping this global crime syndicate is the difficulty of not only tracking the locations of these villains but also prosecuting criminals across international borders. Today, anonymization tools and cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin  ; see   Chapter   4  , 'Managing Business-to-Consumer Electronic Commerce'  ) have lowered the entry barriers for cybercriminals, enabling various 'cybercrime-as-a-service' offerings. Similar to service models used in cloud computing   (see   Chapter   3  )  , crime-as-a-service offerings include not only crimeware as a service, hacking as a service, or cybercrime infrastructure as a service but also research as a service, selling things such as stolen credentials. For example, a would-be cybercriminal can easily 'rent' space on a botnet (including technical support, tremendous resources, and bandwidth) such as the Mirai botnet (which brought down large parts of the U.S. internet infrastructure in late 2016), with weekly access costs of just US$7,500 for 100,000 bots.

IDENTITY THEFT. One of the fastest-growing cybercrimes in recent years has been identity theft (  Figure   10.  10  ). Identity theft is the stealing of another person's Social Security number, credit card number, and other personal data for the purpose of using the victim's credit rating to borrow money, buy merchandise, and otherwise run up debts that are never repaid. In some cases,

## FIGURE 10.10

<!-- image -->

thieves even withdraw money directly from victims' bank accounts. Because many government and private organizations keep data about individuals in accessible databases, opportunities abound for thieves to steal data. Reclaiming one's identity and restoring a good credit rating can be frustrating and time-consuming for victims.

The solution to identity theft lies in the government and private sector working together to change practices used to verify a person's identity. For example, a mother's maiden name and an individual's Social Security number are too easily obtained. Other methods of authentication, such as biometrics and encryption, may need to be used if the problem is to be solved. Methods of information security, including biometrics and encryption, are presented later in our discussion.

## Cyberharassment, Cyberstalking, and Cyberbullying

The anonymity provided by the internet is increasingly used to harass, stalk, and bully others. As defined in Chapter 5, 'Enhancing Organizational Communication and Collaboration Using Social Media,' an internet troll is a person who creates discord on the internet by starting arguments or upsetting people by posting inflammatory content on social media sites with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response, often for their own amusement. In contrast, cyberharassment , a crime in many states and countries, broadly refers to the use of a computer to communicate obscene, vulgar, or threatening content about a person with the intent of harming or harassing that person. A single offensive message can be considered cyberharassment.

Intentionally following, threatening, and/or intimidating someone using electronic means and causing that person to fear for his or her safety is referred to as cyberstalking . While cyberstalking can take many forms and can go undetected by the victim, the intent of cyberbullying is to deliberately cause emotional distress in the victim, often by manipulating, discrediting, or humiliating the victim. Cyberharassment, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying are typically targeted at a person or group as a means of taking revenge or expressing hatred. The widespread and increasing use of mobile devices has led to increases in these incidents. Cyberharassment, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying can take many forms, including the following:

- ■ Making false accusations that damage the reputation of the victim on blogs, websites, chat rooms, or e-commerce sites (e.g., eBay)
- ■ Gaining information about the victim by monitoring online activities, accessing databases, secretly recording video through the victim's webcam, and so on
- ■ Researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about the victim (a practice known as doxing )

- ■ Encouraging others to harass a victim by posting personal information about the victim on websites, chat rooms, or social networking sites
- ■ Attacking data and equipment of the victim by sending email viruses and other destructive code
- ■ Using the internet to place false orders for goods and services, such as magazines, pornography, and other embarrassing items, as well as having such items delivered to work addresses
- ■ Posting incriminating pictures on social networking sites

Many states, the U.S. government, and many countries have laws against cyberharassment and cyberstalking. Unfortunately, law enforcement has a difficult time catching most cyberstalkers.

Online predators typically target vulnerable people, usually the young or old, for sexual or financial purposes. While traditionally online chat rooms and instant messaging systems have been the primary playground for online predators, these villains are increasingly targeting many social networking sites like Facebook. To combat these online predators, parents must educate their children not to share personal information and possibly must use monitoring software to track online activity. Fortunately, most social networking and online chat sites also provide ways to report abuse by these predators. Nevertheless, with the increase in cyberharassment, cyberstalking, cyberbullying, and online predators, it is increasingly important to carefully manage one's privacy in social networks, and to be aware of the potential consequences of any activities in social media.

## Software Piracy

Software developers and marketers want you to buy as many copies of their products as you want, of course. But commercial software vendors do not want you or anyone else to buy one copy and then bootleg additional copies to sell or to give to others. Vendors also take a dim view of companies that buy one copy of a software application and then make many copies to distribute to employees. In fact, these practices are called software piracy and are illegal.

Both patent and copyright laws can apply to software, which is a form of intellectual property-creations of the mind (e.g., music, software, and so on), inventions, names, images, designs, and other works used in commerce. Patents and copyrights are recognized and enforced by most countries, giving the creator exclusive rights to benefit from the creation for a limited period of time. Patents typically refer to process, machine, or material inventions. For example, Amazon's 'one-click buying' process is protected by patent law, and Apple has patented its multitouch technology (including the 'pinch' for shrinking and expanding items) used in the iPhone and iPad. Copyrights generally refer to creations of the mind such as music, literature, or software.

When you buy commercial software, it is typically legal for you to make one copy for your own use for backup purposes (although the software vendor can make it very difficult to copy the software). It is also legal to offer shareware or public domain software for free on a website. But warez peddling-offering stolen proprietary software for free or for sale over the internetis a crime. ( Warez is the slang term for such stolen software.)

Software piracy has become a problem because it is so widespread, costing the commercial software industry and the entire economy billions of dollars a year: A study conducted by the Business Software Alliance suggested that the worldwide value of unlicensed software in 2017 was US$46 billion (BSA, 2018). The crime is difficult to trace, but many individuals and even companies have been successfully prosecuted for pirating software.

Many software vendors are trying to limit software piracy by requiring the users to enter license keys or verifying the key before allowing the customer to register or update the software. To discover and understand protection mechanisms (such as registration or license keys) built into the software by its original developer, computer criminals typically disassemble the software, a practice referred to as reverse engineering . Once the crackers understand the inner workings of the protection mechanism, they can build a key generator that can be used to generate fake license keys to circumvent the protection mechanism. (Reverse engineering is not always destructive and may be legally used to improve a program, but use of the term here implies using the process for gaining unauthorized access to a program's internal structure.)

SOFTWARE PIRACY IS A GLOBAL BUSINESS. A major international issue that businesses deal with is the willingness (or unwillingness) of governments and individuals to recognize and enforce the ownership of intellectual property-in particular, software copyrights.

## FIGURE 10.11

<!-- image -->

Piracy of software and other technologies is widespread internationally (Figure 10.11). The BSA (2018) estimates that about 37 percent of all installed software is unlicensed. The BSA points to countries such as Armenia (85 percent), Moldova (83 percent), Libya (90 percent), and Zimbabwe (89 percent) as those with the highest percentages of illegal software. Countries with the lowest piracy rates include the United States (15 percent), Japan (16 percent), New Zealand (16 percent), and Luxembourg (17 percent). Because technology usage varies significantly by region, average piracy levels and dollar losses greatly differ across regions (Table 10.1). For instance, even though the United States has the lowest piracy rate, it also is the country where the greatest losses occur (more than US$8.6 billion) because of its high level of computer usage.

In addition to being a crime, software piracy can lead to fines or public embarrassment and make users vulnerable to attacks. According to the Business Software Alliance, there is a strong correlation (a correlation coefficient of .78) between unlicensed software and malware. In other words, by using pirated software, organizations expose themselves to a high risk of contracting malware. However, ethical questions surrounding the use of pirated software are often debated. While software piracy is often considered an ethical problem, businesspeople must acknowledge and deal with other perspectives as well. In part, the problem stems from other countries' differing concepts of ownership. Many of the ideas about intellectual property ownership stem from long-standing cultural traditions. For example, the concept of individual ownership of knowledge is traditionally a strange one in many Middle Eastern countries, where knowledge is meant to be shared. Plagiarism does not exist in a culture where words belong to everyone. By the same token, piracy does not exist either. This view is gradually changing; the Saudi Arabia Patent Office granted its first patents several years ago, and its

TABLE 10.1 Software Piracy Levels and Dollar Losses by Region

| Region                     | Piracy Level   |   Dollar Loss (in US$ billions) |
|----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| North America              | 16%            |                             9.5 |
| Western Europe             | 26%            |                             9.5 |
| Asia/Pacific               | 57%            |                            16.4 |
| Latin America              | 52%            |                             5   |
| Middle East and Africa     | 56%            |                             3.1 |
| Central and Eastern Europe | 57%            |                             2.9 |
| Worldwide                  | 37%            |                            46.3 |

piracy rates have plummeted from 79 percent in 1996 to 47 percent in 2017. Other factors leading to piracy or infringement of intellectual property agreements throughout the world include lack of public awareness about the issue and the increasingly high demand for computers and other technology products.

In other cases, there are political, social, and economic reasons for piracy. In many countries, software publishers are not catering to the needs of those consumers who simply may not have the funds to purchase software legitimately. This is true in many areas of South America, Africa, and other regions with low per capita income. It is particularly true of students and other members of university communities whose needs are critical in some areas. Recognizing these issues, many software manufacturers offer educational versions or use differential pricing for different regions.

## Cybersquatting

Another form of piracy is cybersquatting , the dubious practice of registering a domain name and then trying to sell the name for big bucks to the person, company, or organization most likely to want it. Domain names are one of the few scarce resources on the internet, and victims of cybersquatting include Panasonic, Hertz, Avon, and numerous other companies and individuals. Often, cybersquatters use domain names resembling legitimate domains (such as www-facebook-login .com) for conducting phishing attacks or other scams. Fortunately, the U.S. government passed the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in 1999, which made it a crime to register, traffic in, or use a domain name to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. Fines for cybersquatting can reach as high as US$100,000, in addition to the forfeiture of the disputed domain name, and courts have not been kind to cybersquatters. Many feel, however, that it is often much easier simply to pay the cybersquatter because that will likely be much faster and cheaper than to hire a lawyer and go through a lengthy legal process. No matter how companies or individuals deal with this problem, valuable resources of time and money are wasted resolving these disputes.

## Laws Against Computer Crime

In  the  United  States,  there  are  two  main  federal  laws  against  computer  crime:  the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 prohibits the following:

- ■ Stealing or compromising data about national defense, foreign relations, atomic energy, or other restricted information
- ■ Gaining unauthorized access to computers owned by any agency or department of the U.S. government
- ■ Violating data belonging to banks or other financial institutions
- ■ Intercepting or otherwise intruding on communications between states or foreign countries
- ■ Threatening to damage computer systems to extort money or other valuables from persons, businesses, or institutions
- ■ Threatening the U.S. president, vice president, members of Congress, and other administrative members (even if it's just in a critical email)

In 1996, the Computer Abuse Amendments Act expanded the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 to prohibit the dissemination of computer viruses and other harmful code. These and other relevant U.S. laws are listed in Table 10.2. Throughout the world, most countries have some combination of laws to protect data, privacy, and security.

As computer capabilities continue to evolve, so do the crimes that new capabilities enable. Some critics argue that laws do not go far enough to prosecute computer crimes, while others believe that they should not be invoked when systems are breached but no damage is done. Even the definition of 'damage' is debatable. For instance, has damage occurred if someone gains unauthorized access to a computer system but does not steal or change data?

There are additional difficulties in legislating and enforcing laws that affect global networks. Because many countries can be involved when break-ins and other crimes occur, who has jurisdiction? Should email messages be monitored for libelous or other illegal content, and, if so, who should have monitoring responsibility? Should email be subject to the same laws as mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, or should it be more akin to telephone conversations and the laws that apply to them?

| Telephone Consumer Protection Act     | Law that restricts telephone solicitations and the use of automated telephone equipment such as automated dialing systems, prerecorded messages, and text messages and fax machine spam.                             |

## Cyberwar and Cyberterrorism

Over the past several years, individual computer criminals have caused billions of dollars in losses by spreading malware or through unauthorized access to computers. In the future, many believe that coordinated efforts by national governments or terrorist groups have the potential to cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage as well as put the lives of countless people at risk. V arious countries have already become victims of cyberwar and cyberterrorism; for example, in early 2020, a sophisticated cyberattack brought down the entire internet of Iran. A major attack that cripples a country's information infrastructure or power grid, or even the global internet, could have devastating implications for a country's (or the world's) economic system and make transportation systems, medical capabilities, and other key infrastructure extremely vulnerable to disaster, especially given the proliferation of cloud computing for many personal, commercial, and governmental applications.

## Cyberwar

Cyberwar refers to an organized attempt by a country's military to disrupt or destroy the information and communication systems of another country. Cyberwar is often executed simultaneously with traditional methods to quickly dissipate the capabilities of an enemy, and intelligence agencies from countries around the world are secretly probing networks and looking for weaknesses in  their  potential  enemies'  computer  systems.  For  example,  during  the  78-day  Serbia/ Kosovo war in 1999, the United States reportedly conducted its first cyberwar campaign using a team of information warriors to support its bombing campaign against Serbia. The U.S. information operation cell electronically attacked Serbia's critical networks and command-and-control systems. However, given that the United States and NATO alliance is the most technologically sophisticated war machine in the world-and also the most dependent on its networking and computing infrastructure-it is also the most vulnerable to cyberwar (or cyberterrorism) attacks.

CYBERWAR VULNERABILITIES. The goal of cyberwar is to turn the balance of power-through information and knowledge-in one's favor to enhance one's capabilities while diminishing those of an opponent. Cyberwar utilizes a diverse range of technologies, including software, hardware, and networking technologies, to gain an information advantage over an opponent. These technologies can be used to electronically blind, jam, deceive, overload, and intrude into an enemy's information systems infrastructure to diminish various capabilities, including the following:

- ■ Command-and-control systems
- ■ Intelligence collection, processing, and distribution systems

## DIGITAL DENSITY

## Backdoors in Every Mobile Phone?

With increasing digital density in all aspects of our lives, it is no surprise that our mobile phones have become significant work devices that also happen to facilitate our personal lives. from a work perspective, mobile computing puts data at our fingertips when and where we need it, leading to improvements in access to corporate data and increased worker productivity. from a personal perspective, mobile devices contain a wealth of data about our personal activities and interests, some of which could be used to assist law enforcement for data discovery. Accordingly, many high-profile cases have occurred between law enforcement and tech companies regarding access to data stored on our phones.

one of the most prominent examples occurred in late 2015, when Syed Rizwan farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and seriously injured 22 in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. following the attack, the fBI obtained farook's work iPhone. However, as the iPhone was locked with an access code, the contents of the phone would be erased if more than 10 failed login attempts occurred, so the fBI asked Apple to provide a backdoor into farook's iPhone in order to access the phone's contents. After Apple refused to unlock the phone, arguing that it would violate trust with its customers, the fBI sued Apple to provide a new operating system that would essentially provide a backdoor into the phone, a suit that was eventually dropped. The dispute between Apple and the fBI was revisited again in late 2019 after a shooting at a Naval base in florida, and Apple again refused to assist the fBI. In both instances, the fBI was able to find another method for unlocking the phones, finding a wealth of incriminating data in both cases.

These events and others have sparked a strong debate about the balance between security and privacy. Advocates say that Apple should never be compelled to unlock one of its phones, as providing a backdoor can result in an unreasonable 'search and seizure' of protected data; when a government accesses electronic devices through such a backdoor, it is

- ■
- Tactical communication systems and methods
- ■ Troop and weapon positioning systems
- ■ Friend-or-foe identification systems
- ■ Smart weapons systems

Additionally, controlling the content and distribution of propaganda and information to an opponent's civilians, troops, and government is a key part of a cyberwar strategy. At the simplest level, web vandalism can occur by defacing an opponent's websites. Likewise, cyberpropaganda can be quickly and easily distributed through websites, email, and social media (as can be seen in the rise of coordinated posts on Twitter promoting disinformation, challenging democratic institutions, or generally undermining trust in institutions); with increasing sophistication of AI algorithms, creating deepfakes-AI-generated fake audio or video content   (see   Chapter   6  )  becomes ever easier, further enabling the spreading of misinformation and conducting information warfare. Espionage-stealing of secrets or modifying information-can occur if data and systems are not adequately protected and secure.

conducting an electronic version of such banned searches. Security advocates argue that security is a common good that is promised to all, and the most important job of government is to 'secure the general welfare' of its citizens; thus, security must outweigh any personal concerns about privacy, and it is necessary to unlock some phones when it is important to protect society. This debate between privacy and security is not new. over the millennia, there have been debates about the trade-offs between security and privacy, and the Apple versus fBI case will not end this debate.

While there are several known attacks, most governments deny involvement. Typically, governments accused of cyberwar activities blame uncontrolled patriot hackers -independent citizens or supporters of a country that perpetrate attacks on perceived or real enemies. A notable example of such an attack happened in June 2010 when a Belarus-based computer security company discovered a computer worm called Stuxnet on a computer system belonging to an Iranian client. Stuxnet is a computer worm designed to find and infect a specific type of industrial hardware inside Iranian nuclear plants. Once Stuxnet found its intended target-centrifuges within Iran's nuclear enrichment program-it was programmed to manipulate their motor speeds. The manipulation of the motor speeds beyond normal operating tolerances would ultimately destroy the equipment, slowing and degrading the nuclear program. Since its discovery, computer security experts around the globe have studied its design. Stuxnet is a very sophisticated and unprecedented method for attacking an adversary. While most experts agreed that Stuxnet was most likely designed by a nation-state, from the time of its discovery, no country had come forward to admit involvement in its creation. This suspicion ended in June 2012, when it was revealed that Israel and the United States worked together to design Stuxnet. It is one of the first examples where cyberwarfare was used to inflict physical damage to critical infrastructures of a nation-state. Another (admittedly less damaging attack) on the Iranian nuclear program happened in 2012, when malware introduced into Iranian nuclear facilities caused computers to play AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck' at full volume in the middle of the night.

It is also often difficult to differentiate cyberattacks by known terrorist groups from those of legitimate governments. Many governments such as Iran, Syria, North Korea, and others have been suspected of supporting the activities of terrorist organizations. For example, in 2016, Pakistani intelligence agents used an app called SmeshApp to spy on Indian army personnel who were tricked into installing the app on their smartphones. SmeshApp provided similar capabilities as the popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram. After being downloaded, the app gained access to contacts, photos, and other personal data as well as captured the phone's contact list, messaging data, email, browsing history, and so on. Ultimately, data gained from the app were sent to a database in Germany that was allegedly controlled by Pakistani intelligence. Data captured from this activity were provided to Pakistani-based terrorists who launched an attack on India's Pathankot Air Force Station that killed several people.

In traditional war, destroying equipment by dropping a bomb is an act of war. Time will tell how nation-states will respond to cyberattacks that ultimately cause similar damage, and regardless of the source of these attacks, it is clear that one of the big challenges for governments moving forward will be to fully integrate a cyberwar strategy into their overall plans and capabilities.

## Cyberterrorism

Unlike cyberwar, cyberterrorism is  launched  not  by  governments  but  by  individuals  and organized  groups.  Cyberterrorism  is  the  use  of  computer  and  networking  technologies against persons or property to intimidate or coerce governments, civilians, or any segment of  society  to  attain  political,  religious,  or  ideological  goals.  One  of  the  great  fears  about cyberterrorism is that an attack can be launched from a computer anywhere in the world-no borders have to be crossed, no bombs smuggled and placed, and no cyberterrorists' lives are lost in carrying out the attack. Because computers and networking systems control power plants, telephone systems, and transportation systems as well as water and oil pipelines, any disruption of these systems could cause loss of life or widespread chaos. Just as physical terrorist attacks have physical and psychological effects, so also do cyberattacks. Dealing with the unknown-where, when, and how-of an indiscriminant terrorist attack is what leads to 'terror.'

WHAT KINDS OF ATTACKS ARE CONSIDERED CYBERTERRORISM? Cyberterrorism could involve physical destruction of computer systems or acts that destroy economic stability or infrastructure. Cyberterrorist acts could likely damage the machines that control traffic lights, power plants, dams, or airline traffic to create fear and panic. Attacks launched in cyberspace could take many forms, such as viruses, denial of service, destruction of government computers, stealing classified files, altering web page content, deleting or corrupting vital

information, disrupting media broadcasts, and otherwise interrupting the flow of information. Table 10.3 summarizes several categories of attacks that experts believe cyberterrorists could try to deliver.

The goal of cyberterrorists is to cause fear, panic, and destruction. Through the power of computer technology and global networks, terrorists can gain access to critical parts of the world's infrastructure to produce both physical and virtual terror. Given the great potential for cyberterrorism, many experts believe that it will, unfortunately, become the weapon of choice for the world's most sophisticated terrorists.

HOW THE INTERNET IS CHANGING THE BUSINESS PROCESSES OF TERRORISTS. Just as the internet has fueled globalization for organizations and societies, it too has fueled global terrorism, and virtually all modern terrorist groups utilize the internet. Beyond using the internet to wage cyberattacks, the internet is a powerful tool for improving and streamlining the business processes of the modern terrorist (Table 10.4).

ASSESSING THE CYBERTERRORISM THREAT. Some experts claim that because of the general openness of access, the internet infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to cyberterrorism. Each year, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, dams, and power grids are increasing. While most of such attacks have not done damage at this point, a few have been alarmingly successful and concerning:

- ■ In May 2003, Romanian crackers compromised systems that housed life-support control for 58 scientists and contractors in Antarctica. FBI agents assisted in the arrest of the crackers, who attempted to extort money from the research station.
- ■ In May 2007, government networks and commercial banks within Estonia came under a very sophisticated cyberattack by cyberterrorists in retaliation for the removal of a Sovietera memorial to fallen soldiers.
- ■ In 2010-2013, 'The Jester,' believed to be a former U.S. soldier, claimed responsibility for attacks on WikiLeaks, Islamists' websites, and even the website of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After a successful attack, The Jester broadcast 'TANGO DOWN'-a military term that means a target has been injured or killed-on Twitter.
- ■ In 2015, a group called CyberCaliphate attacked TV5, a French media outlet, taking control of its website and social media accounts and incapacitating its broadcasting for hours. It also published the names of family members, along with various threats, of French military personnel.
- ■ In 2017, Russia was likely responsible for a series of powerful cyberattacks that swamped the websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers, and electricity utilities.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information dissemination   | The use of websites and social media to disseminate propaganda to current and potential supporters, to influence international public opinion, and to notify potential enemies of pending plans                                            |
| Data mining                 | The use of advanced analytics to collect and analyze the vast amount of structured and unstructured data available on the internet regarding virtually any topic for planning, recruitment, and numerous other endeavors                   |
| Fundraising                 | The use of websites for bogus charities and nongovernmental organizations to raise funds and transfer currencies around the world                                                                                                          |
| Recruiting and mobilization | The use of websites to provide information for recruiting new members as well as roaming online chat rooms, social media, and cybercafés for receptive individuals                                                                         |
| Networking                  | The use of the internet to enable a less hierarchical, cell-based organizational structure that is difficult to combat; networking capabilities also allow different groups with common enemies to better share and coordinate information |
| Information sharing         | The use of the internet as a powerful tool for announcing events as well as sharing best practices                                                                                                                                         |
| Training                    | The use of the internet to disseminate training materials. For example, the official Hamas website details how to make homemade poisons and gases, and Syrian rebels useYouTube to disseminate weapons training videos.                    |
| Planning and coordinating   | The use of communication and information dissemination capabilities to facilitate designing and execut- ing plans                                                                                                                          |
| Information gathering       | The use of mapping software such as Google Earth to locate potential targets for terrorist attacks                                                                                                                                         |
| Location monitoring         | The use of public webcams to monitor and study potential attack sites (e.g., public places or civil infra- structure such as tunnels or power generation facilities)                                                                       |

While cyberterrorism obviously remains a threat to computer and network security, some experts point out that there are disadvantages to using acts of cyberterrorism as a weapon, including the following:

1. Computer systems and networks are complex, so cyberattacks are difficult to control and may not achieve the desired destruction as effectively as physical weapons.
2. Computer systems and networks change, and security measures improve, so an everincreasing level of knowledge and expertise on the part of intruders is required for cyberattacks to be effective. This means that perpetrators will be required to continuously study and hone their skills as older methods of attack no longer work.
3. Cyberattacks rarely cause physical harm to victims; therefore, there is less drama and emotional appeal than for perpetrators using conventional weapons.

Some experts believe that the likelihood of a devastating attack that causes significant disruption in the major U.S. infrastructure systems is quite low because of the resources and intelligence needed carry out a sophisticated attack. Nevertheless, small attacks have been occurring for years and are likely to increase in frequency and severity; even a 'small' attack, like an individual suicide bomber, can cause tremendous chaos in a society. While cyberterrorism and cyberwar may be methods of choice for future generations with advanced computer knowledge, experts are hopeful that the increasing sophistication of computer security measures will help reduce the number of such incidents.

RESPONDING TO GLOBAL CYBERTERRORISM THREATS. With the proliferation of and dependence on technology increasing at an astronomical rate, the threat of cyberterrorism will continue to increase. As has been true with virtually all governments and business organizations, fueled by the digitization of information and the internet, terrorism has become a global business. To be adequately prepared, national governments along with industry partners must design coordinated responses to various attack scenarios. In addition to greater cooperation and preparedness, governments must improve their intelligence-gathering capabilities so that potential attacks are

## ETHICAL DILEMMA

## Ethics and Cyberwar: Just Because We Can, Should We?

one of the realities of the digital world is constant and unrelenting change. The exponential increase in performance of computers has helped to usher in new gadgets and technologies that can do new things that were once unimaginable. All this change has resulted in many positive advances, from the promise of commercial space travel to self-driving cars. What often doesn't keep pace with all this innovation and change are the laws and ethical standards for what should or should not be legal or ethical to do. for example, because it is technically possible for the government to listen to any of your phone calls, read any of your email messages, or monitor your online activity, what legal and ethical bounds should be enforced?

international agreements related to the humane treatment of war prisoners, acceptable justification to engage in war, acceptable wartime conduct, and so on). In less technologically advanced societies, repairing the damage caused by a massive cyberattack may be especially difficult, resulting in excessive and long-term impacts on civilians and society. Crippling a country's power grid, telephone, and banking systems may provide a strong strategic advantage in a war but may have equally damaging effects on its citizens and society.

## Questions

1. What are the ethical implications of drone strikes?

Just as technology is transforming how we work and live, it is also transforming how war can be conducted. By now, we are familiar with airstrikes conducted by drones, controlled by personnel located in a safe facility at a remote airbase. These drone strikes effectively enable the killing of people without putting oneself into harm's way. Likewise, cyberwar raises many serious issues for societies-issues that need to be addressed by policies and agreements. Cyber-weapons are difficult to precisely target, given the interdependence of most modern computer systems. As such, collateral damage to civilian targets is a major concern (e.g., a nasty computer virus targeting military computers might simultaneously take out civilian computers). Avoiding disproportionate damage to civilians is a key part of the geneva Conventions and the law of war (i.e., a series of

2. Should cyberwar attacks be prosecutable as war crimes? If so, under which circumstances?

thwarted before they begin. Industry must also be given incentives to secure their information resources so that losses and disruptions in operations are minimized. International laws and treaties must rapidly evolve to reflect the realities of cyberterrorism, where attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. Clearly, there are great challenges ahead.

## Managing Information Systems Security

Everyone who uses an information system (IS) knows that disasters can happen to stored data or to entire systems. Some disasters are unintentional, such as accidents caused by power outages, inexperienced computer users, or mistakes, while others are deliberate, caused on purpose by malicious crackers. The primary threats to the security of information systems include the following (Figure 10.12):

- ■ Natural Disasters: power outages, hurricanes, floods, and so on
- ■ Accidents: inexperienced or careless computer operators (or cats walking across keyboards!)
- ■ Employees and Consultants: people within an organization who have access to electronic data
- ■ Links to Outside Business Contacts: electronic data that can be at risk when it travels between or among business affiliates as part of doing business (i.e., any data that travel via public networks, such as the internet, are at risk)
- ■ Outsiders: hackers and crackers who penetrate networks and computer systems to snoop or to cause damage (Viruses-perpetually rampant on the internet-are included in this category.)

## FIGURE 10.12

Threats to IS security.

<!-- image -->

For individuals as well as organizations, trying to recover from disasters carries high costs in terms of time and money; in addition, organizations can lose much goodwill if their systems are unavailable (no matter what the reason is), their systems are compromised by malicious crackers, or customer data are stolen. How do you secure information systems from such dangers? How do you know what systems are at risk of being compromised? The rule of thumb for deciding whether an information system is at risk is simple: All systems connected to networks are vulnerable to security violations from both insiders and outsiders as well as to virus infections and other forms of computer crime. This is becoming especially problematic as organizations move more of their processes and data to the cloud, implicitly trusting the availability and security managed by the cloud provider. Further, no information system is immune to intentional or unintentional physical harm. In short, threats to information systems can come from a variety of places internal and external to an organization.

Information systems security refers to precautions taken to keep all aspects of information systems (e.g., all hardware, software, network equipment, and data) safe from destruction, manipulation, or unauthorized access or use while providing the intended functionality to legitimate users. Specifically, organizations must consider the following:

- ■ Availability: ensuring that legitimate users can access the system
- ■ Integrity: ensuring that unauthorized manipulations of data and systems (that may compromise accuracy, completeness, or reliability of data) are prevented
- ■ Confidentiality: ensuring that data are protected from unauthorized access
- ■ Accountability: ensuring that actions can be traced

Hence, for organizations, it is essential to carefully manage IS risk and to ensure business continuity by securing their IS infrastructure. As organizations cannot avoid using the internet and related telecommunications technologies and systems, organizations must be aware of the various dangerous vulnerabilities the use of such networks can create. These networks can be infiltrated and/or subverted in various ways. Consequently, the need for tight computer and network security has increased dramatically. Fortunately, there are a variety of managerial methods and security technologies that can be used to manage IS security effectively. However, as threats

<!-- image -->

to information systems constantly evolve, information systems security is an ongoing process, consisting of (Figure 10.13):

1. Assessing risks
2. Developing a security strategy
3. Implementing controls and training
4. Monitoring security

In addition, organizations should continuously watch for emerging threats and vulnerabilities as well as attacks (including attacks on other organizations) to update risk assessments and strategies and implement additional controls.

## Assessing Risks

Maintaining customer confidence is essential for any organization, and IS security-related incidents can  lead  to  reputation,  operational,  legal,  and  strategic  risks.  Consequently,  good  approaches  to securing information systems begin first with a thorough information systems risk assessment to obtain an understanding of the risks to the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of data and systems. It would not make sense to spend millions of dollars a year to protect an asset the loss of which would cost the organization only a few thousand dollars. As a result, organizations attempt to identify and rank the risks to develop the most effective strategies. In other words, organizations assess the value of the assets being protected, determine their probability of being compromised, and compare the probable costs of their being compromised with the estimated costs of whatever protections they might have to take. Protecting an asset only makes economic sense if the cost of protecting it is less than (or equal to) its value (and the associated data that can be lost or damage that can be done) multiplied by the probability of a disaster. Thus, organizations perform risk assessments for their systems to ensure that IS security programs make sense economically (Stallings, 2020).

Such assessment should encompass all of an organization's systems, including hardware, software, data, networks, and any business processes that involve them to identify threats and vulnerabilities, determine the probabilities of vulnerabilities being exploited, and assess the potential impact (i.e., the severity of the consequences if a threat indeed causes damage by exploiting a vulnerability) (Figure 10.14). Threats are typically defined as undesirable events that can cause harm and can arise from actions performed by agents internal or external to an organization. In other words, threats can come from current or former insiders (such as employees, contractors, etc.) as well as criminals, competitors, terrorists, or the elements (the term cloud-native threats refers to threats emerging from increasing use of cloud computing, which require different responses). In contrast, vulnerabilities are defined as weaknesses in an

organization's systems or security policies that can be exploited to cause damage and can encompass both known vulnerabilities (such as vulnerabilities discovered during audits) and expected vulnerabilities (such as unpatched software, new attack methodologies, or staff turnover). The increasing use of application programming interfaces (APIs) especially increases the potential for vulnerabilities. While the use of APIs offers many benefits for organizations, insecure APIs can often be the weakest link in an organization's cybersecurity defense. Threat modeling is used to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to help identify needed safeguards.

By understanding and evaluating these factors, organizations can then design and implement a security strategy that makes the best use of the available resources to eliminate vulnerabilities or reduce impacts. In addition to an information systems risk assessment, organizations then periodically perform security audits to determine the effectiveness of the implemented measures. People within the IS department are usually responsible for implementing the security measures chosen, though people from throughout the organization should participate in the risk assessment.

To get a thorough understanding of risks, organizations need to consider both technical information (such as information about databases, hardware and software, and networks) and nontechnical information (such as information about processes and procedures related to physical or personnel security) to determine and assess the threats and vulnerabilities. Typically, a thorough information systems risk assessment uses both quantitative data (such as value of an asset or implementation costs of security measures) and qualitative data (e.g., results from interviews or walkthroughs) to arrive at a risk rating that reflects the possible impact, likelihood, and ultimate risk level for each particular function or asset (Table 10.5).

This risk rating then enables the organization to determine what steps, if any, to take to secure systems. Large organizations typically use a balance of different approaches, taking steps in risk reduction for some systems, accepting risk and living with it in other cases (i.e., risk acceptance ), and also insuring all or most of their systems activities (i.e., risk transference ). A fourth categoryrisk avoidance (e.g., by not engaging in e-commerce, not having a website, or not using email)-can often be impractical or even infeasible in today's networked environment. See Table 10.6 for a summary of these options.

TABLE 10.6 Options for Addressing IS Risks

| Option            | Description                                                                 | Condition                                                                                |

| Risk transference | Having someone else absorb the risk                                         | • Other parties may be better equipped to manage the risk                                |
| Risk avoidance    | Using alternate means or not per- forming tasks that would cause risk       | • Risk is unmanageable • Risk is too high                                                |

For organizations, increasing digital density (see Chapter 1, 'Managing in the Digital World') has led to the need to a far more wide-reaching risk assessment. For example, data on mobile devices are often particularly vulnerable to being compromised, and organizations using cloud computing often place their data and applications in the hands of third parties, which may or may not have appropriate security measures in place (note that using reliable cloud service providers is a common risk transference strategy). Likewise, the Internet of Things can expose organizations to a multitude of vulnerabilities; data generated by various sensors may open the door to identity theft or hacking, and criminals may attempt gain control over smart objects to use them for nefarious purposes. Thus, risk assessment and management should cover all devices that companies use to interact with their customers (Jordan, 2019).

## Developing a Security Strategy

Once risks are assessed, a strategy should be formulated that details what information systems controls (in terms of technology, people, and policies) should be implemented. By ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information, the controls help an organization to control costs, gain and protect trust, remain competitive, and comply with internal or external governance mandates (e.g., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, discussed later in this section). Such controls can consist of a variety of different measures; to be most effective, an IS security strategy should focus on the following:

- ■ Preventive controls: to prevent any potentially negative event from occurring, such as by preventing outside intruders from accessing a facility
- ■ Detective controls: to assess whether anything went wrong, such as unauthorized access attempts, and to limit damage
- ■ Corrective controls: to mitigate the impact of any problem after it has arisen, such as restoring compromised data

Whereas most efforts should focus on prevention, detection and correction are important to compensate for any weaknesses in preventive measures, and organizations must strike the balance between implementing preventive measures and providing functionality for the users. Thus, organizations use the principles of least permissions and least privileges , meaning that users should only be given access to the systems, data, or resources that are needed to perform their duties and should be restricted from accessing other resources (Figure 10.15). Typically, information systems controls comprise multiple layers such that a potential attacker must break several layers to conduct a successful attack; using multiple defense layers not only helps thwart the attack but also increases the chances of detecting the attacker.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. Very often some of the best things that people can do to secure their information systems are not technical in nature. Instead, they involve changes within the organization and/or better management of people's use of information systems. For example, one of the outcomes of the risk assessment described here may well be a set of computer and/ or internet use policies (sometimes referred to as acceptable use policies ) for people within the organization, with clearly spelled-out penalties for noncompliance (Figure 10.16).

In general, policies and procedures that guide users' decisions and establish responsibilities include the following:

- ■ Confidential Information Policy: outlines how sensitive information will be handled, stored, transmitted, and destroyed
- ■ Security Policy: explains technical controls on all organizational computer systems, such as access limitations, audit-control software, firewalls, and so on
- ■ Use Policy: outlines the organization's policies regarding appropriate use of in-house computer systems; may restrict personal internet surfing, forbid use of company computer systems for non-employment related purposes, restrict use of social networking and email, and so on
- ■ Backup Policy: explains requirements for backing up data so that critical data can be restored in case of data loss
- ■ Account Management Policy: lists procedures for adding new users to systems and removing users who have left the organization
- ■ Incident Handling Procedures: lists procedures to follow when handling a security breach
- ■ Disaster Recovery Plan: lists all the steps an organization will take to restore computer operations in case of a natural or deliberate disaster (Each department within the organization generally has its own disaster recovery plan; see the following discussion.)

While establishing such policies and procedures is crucial, they need to be clearly communicated; organizations often require employees to acknowledge the acceptance of policies to mitigate risks arising from employee noncompliance, and mechanisms should be in place for enforcing these. Needless to say, such policies and procedures must be continually reviewed and updated to account for environmental changes. More fundamental to security than management techniques such as these is that you make every effort to hire trustworthy employees and treat them well. Trustworthy employees who are treated well are less likely to commit offenses affecting the organization's information systems.

DISASTER PLANNING. In some cases, all attempts to provide a reliable and secure IS infrastructure are in vain, and disasters cannot be avoided. Thus, organizations need to be prepared for potential impacts. A business continuity plan describes how a business continues operating after a disaster before normal operations have been restored; relatedly, a disaster recovery plan spells

out detailed procedures for recovering from systems-related disasters, such as virus infections and other disasters that might cripple the IS infrastructure. This way, even under the worst-case scenario, people will be able to replace or reconstruct critical files or data, or they will at least have a plan readily available to begin the recovery process. A typical disaster recovery plan includes information that answers the following questions:

- ■ What events are considered a disaster?
- ■ What should be done to prepare the backup site?
- ■ What is the chain of command, and who can declare a disaster?
- ■ What hardware and software are needed to recover from a disaster?
- ■ Which personnel are needed for staffing the backup sites?
- ■ What is the sequence for moving back to the original location after recovery?
- ■ Which providers can be drawn on to aid in the disaster recovery process?

Backup sites are critical for business continuity in the event a disaster strikes; in other words, backup sites can be thought of as a company's office in a temporary location. In addition, organizations should have backups of important data in place. Typically, such backups use media such as external hard drives, CDs, or tapes, or data are backed up to online backup service providers at regular intervals. No matter what the medium is, backed-up data should be encrypted so that in the event computer criminals gain access to the backup media, the data are useless to them.

Commonly, a distinction is made between cold and hot backup sites. A cold backup site is nothing more than an empty warehouse with all necessary connections for power and communication but nothing else. In the case of a disaster, a company must first set up all necessary equipment, ranging from office furniture to web servers. While this is the least expensive option, it also takes a relatively longer time before a company can resume working after a disaster. A hot backup site , in contrast, is a fully equipped backup facility, having everything from office chairs to a one-to-one replication of the most current data. In the event of a disaster, all that must be done is to relocate the employees to the backup site to continue working. Obviously, this is a very expensive option, as the backup site must be kept fully equipped and all the IS infrastructure duplicated.

DESIGNING THE RECOVERY PLAN. When planning for disaster, two primary objectives should be considered by an organization: recovery time and recovery point objectives. Recovery time objectives specify the maximum time allowed to recover from a catastrophic event. For example, should the organization be able to resume operations in minutes, hours, or days after the disaster? Companies using cloud-based backup services often forget that restoring large quantities of data from the cloud can take a long time; having completely redundant systems helps minimize the recovery time and might be best suited for mission-critical systems, such as e-commerce transaction servers. For other applications, such as data mining, while important, the recovery time can be longer without disrupting primary business processes.

Recovery point objectives specify how current the backup data should be. Imagine that your computer's hard drive crashes while you are working on a term paper. Luckily, you recently backed up your data. Would you prefer the last backup to be a few days old, or would you rather have the last backup include your most recent changes to the term paper? Hot backup sites typically have a redundant backup of the data so that the business processes are interrupted as little as possible and data loss is minimized (or even avoided) in the event of a catastrophic failure. To achieve this redundancy, all data are mirrored on separate servers (i.e., everything is stored synchronously on two independent systems). This might seem expensive, but for a critical business application involving customers, it may be less expensive to run a redundant backup system in parallel than it would be to disrupt business or lose customers in the event of catastrophic system failure.

Often, companies choose to replicate their data centers in multiple locations. Thinking about the location of redundant systems is an important aspect of disaster planning. If a company relies on redundant systems, all of which are located within the same building, a single event can incapacitate all the systems. Similarly, events such as a hurricane can damage systems that are located across town from each other. Thus, even if the primary infrastructure is located in-house, it pays to have a backup located in a different geographic area to minimize the risk of a disaster happening to both systems.

## Implementing Controls and Training

Once a comprehensive strategy has been formulated, organizations can decide which controls to implement and train personnel regarding security policies and measures. Such controls can encompass different measures, such as systems security policies and their physical implementation,

access restrictions, or record keeping, to be able to trace actions and transactions and who is responsible for these. IS controls thus need to be applied throughout the entire IS infrastructure. There  are  two  broad  categories  of  approaches  for  reducing  risk-technological-  and  humanbased approaches-and any comprehensive security strategy will include both. Commonly used controls to safeguard information systems include:

- ■ Physical access restrictions
- ■ Firewalls
- ■ Encryption
- ■ Virus monitoring and prevention
- ■ Secure data centers
- ■ Mobile device management
- ■ Systems development controls
- ■ Human controls

Within any type of control, there are a variety of ways in which it can be deployed. Next, we briefly review each of these methods.

PHYSICAL ACCESS RESTRICTIONS. Organizations can prevent unauthorized access to information systems by keeping stored data safe and allowing access only to those employees who need it to do their jobs. Of course, organizations can protect computers and data resources by physically securing computers to desks or requiring users to lock hard drives with keys when leaving a computer unattended. However, most organizations don't go to such lengths and control access only

## SECURITY MATTERS

## Back to the Future: Analog May Be the Future of Securing Critical Infrastructure

over the past 50 years, the world has evolved from the analog to the modern digital world. Analog devices represent data as continuous variable quantities, such as length, width, voltage, sound, or pressure. In an old car, for example, an analog speedometer would indicate the rate of travel in miles (or kilometers) per hour by a dial that might range from 0 to 120 MPH. As the car's speed changed, so too would a centermounted needle to indicate the current speed. other analog devices include classic record players and tube amplifiers that many top musicians like to use. one major drawback of analog data is that they cannot be easily and quickly shared or transmitted over networks. In the modern digital world, however, we have embraced the power of precisely controlled computer-based devices, leveraging databases, and sharing data across networks throughout the world; digital recordings of music are shared with millions of customers around the world using networked platforms like Apple Music or youTube, companies use the internet to interconnect their global supply chains to better serve their customers, and various devices or even entire factories can be controlled remotely.

While the use of digital computers has led to a tidal wave of positive change throughout the world, cyberterrorism experts have suggested that a layered approach of both digital and analog systems be used to protect critical infrastructure components such as nuclear power plants, power grid substations, and water treatment plants. A digitally networked control infrastructure provides many benefits, such as remote monitoring and greater flexibility. However, virtually every system that is connected to a network can be remotely hacked, while old-school analog systems require a human operator to turn a dial or flip a switch. In other words, analog equipment cannot be infected by malware and commandeered by hackers, such as what happened to ukraine's power grid in December 2015 and again in June 2017. Inspired by these events, legislators in the u.S. government passed the Secure Energy Infrastructure Act in 2019 to implement an analog 'backstop' from digital hacking by isolating the most critical control systems and segmenting the power grid.

Authentication

<!-- image -->

by requiring some form of identification and authentication to authorize the access of resources by a user (Figure 10.17). Typically, identification is a user's claim or declaration of being someone. A user's identity is normally established using publicly available information, such as a username (or even bank account number); the identifying information is typically unique (within the context of a certain system). Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a user who is attempting to access a restricted system or web site. In contrast to identification, authentication is private, such as a PIN or a password, but not necessarily unique. Passwords are effective only if chosen carefully and changed frequently. Likewise, organizations must take care to securely store the users' passwords at the organizations' end; if the passwords stored on the e-commerce server are not secure, determined crackers can easily get access to the users' passwords. Thus, systems such as e-commerce websites typically do no store a user's password but an encrypted version called a hash value (which is extremely difficult to decrypt), which is then compared to a hashed version of the password the user enters. Even if crackers are successful in breaking into the organization's systems, they will be unable to gain access to users' passwords.

Besides passwords, users may be asked to provide an ID combination, a security code sequence, or personal data, such as their mother's maiden name. Employees may also be issued keys to physically unlock a computer, photo ID cards, smart cards with digital ID, and other physical devices allowing computer access. Based on the combination of identification and authentication, authorization is provided by the system and grants access to particular resources. In sum, authorization can be granted dependent on one or more of the following:

- ■ Something You Have: keys, picture identification cards, smart cards, or smart badges that contain memory chips with authentication data on them (Figure 10.18)

<!-- image -->

- ■ Something You Know: passwords, code numbers, PINs, lock combinations, or answers to secret questions (your pet's name, your mother's maiden name, and so on)
- ■ Something You Are: unique attributes, such as fingerprints, voice patterns, facial characteristics, or retinal patterns (collectively called biometrics )

Biometrics Biometrics is one of the most sophisticated forms of governing access to systems, data, and/or facilities. With biometrics, employees may be identified and/or authenticated by fingerprints, retinal patterns in the eye, facial features, or other bodily characteristics before being granted access to use a computer or to enter a facility (Figure 10.19). Biometrics has the promise of providing very high security while at the same time authenticating people extremely efficiently, so many governments and companies are investigating how best to use this technology. For example, many laptops and computer keyboards now incorporate fingerprint readers. Likewise, many smartphones let you log in by using your fingerprint or looking into the phone's camera (facial recognition software then matches the user's face with a stored profile); MasterCard, Amazon, and others are introducing pay-by-selfie, allowing customers to authorize transactions by using their device's camera (with other companies using different biometrics, such as voice recognition).

Two-Factor Authentication Some measures that limit access to systems are more secure than others. For example, smart cards and smart badges, passwords, lock combinations, and code numbers can be stolen. Biometric devices are difficult to fool, but determined intruders may sometimes devise ways to bypass them; further, in contrast to passwords, biometric information cannot be hashed, and any cracker breaking into an organization could obtain the users' actual biometric data (such as fingerprints, which are often relatively easy to obtain). If compromised, passwords can be easily changed; however, biometrics cannot be revoked if they are compromised (e.g., you can't change your retinal patterns or fingerprints). Likewise, the use of biometrics for both identification and authorization may be problematic from a security standpoint. Thus, while any of the previously mentioned single items can be used, it is safer to use combinations of safeguards, such as a password and a smart card. The use of two types of credentials to gain access to a system is referred to as two-factor authentication . Today, two-factor authentication is often used for banking transactions, where the user has to enter not only a password but also a one-time token provided by the bank (such as provided by a key fob or sent to the user's registered email address or mobile phone number); similarly, residents of Hong Kong can quickly pass through immigration checkpoints by using a smart card and their thumbprints. No matter what safeguards are used, organizations should have formal processes in place for enrolling new users, authorizing specific users to access systems or data, identifying and authenticating the users, and monitoring the access of resources. Also, policies should be in place to revoke access for employees who are leaving the company or who are taking on different roles or responsibilities. Next, we examine various methods for implementing physical access control.

Access-Control Software Following the principles of least permissions and least privileges, access should only be granted to the resources needed to perform the work; anything beyond that can be a potential vulnerability. Access-control software can reduce such vulnerabilities by allowing computer users access only to those files related to their work. The user might even be

<!-- image -->

restricted to these resources only at certain times or for specified periods of time, and, depending on the access level, the user can be restricted to being able to only read a file, to read and edit the file, to add to the file, and/or to delete the file. Many common business systems applications now build in these kinds of security features so that you do not have to have additional, separate access-control software running on top of your applications software.

Wireless LAN Control Given how easy and inexpensive wireless local area networks (WLANs) are to install and use, their use has skyrocketed, leaving many systems open to attack. On an unsecured network, for instance, unauthorized people can thus easily 'steal' company resources (e.g., by surfing the web for free, which is illegal in many countries) or do considerable damage to the network. A new form of attack known as drive-by hacking has arisen, where an attacker accesses the network, intercepts data from it, and even uses network services and/ or sends attack instructions to it without having to enter the home, office, or organization that owns the network (Figure 10.20). Whereas attackers tended to attack computers connected to networks, the increase of IoT (and especially home automation) devices, which often lack security, has contributed to a steep rise in attack vectors. Wireless LAN control refers to methods of configuring the WLAN so that only authorized users can gain access.

Virtual Private Networks A virtual private network (VPN) is a network connection that is constructed dynamically within an existing network-often called a secure tunnelto connect users or nodes (Figure 10.21). For example, many companies and software solutions enable you to create VPNs within the internet as the medium for transporting data. These systems use authentication and encryption (discussed later) and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the VPN and that the data cannot be intercepted and compromised; this practice of creating an encrypted 'tunnel' to send secure (private) data over the (public) internet is known as tunneling . For example, the University of Arizona requires VPN software to be used when accessing some critical resources from remote (off-campus) locations.

FIREWALLS. A firewall is a part of a computer system designed to detect intrusion and block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network (Figure 10.22). Think of a firewall as a security fence around the perimeter of an organization's networks that spots any intruders that try to penetrate the organization's outer defenses. Firewalls can be implemented in hardware, in software, or in a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to block potentially malicious traffic from entering private networks connected to the internet, especially private corporate intranets (see Chapter 3). All data packets entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.

## FIGURE 10.20

Drive-by hacking is on the rise given the proliferation of unsecured wireless LANs.

ENCRYPTION. When you do not have access to a secure channel for transmitting messages over a wired or wireless network, encryption is the best bet for keeping snoopers out. Encryption is the process of encoding messages using an encryption key before they enter the network or airwaves, then decoding them using a matching key at the receiving end of the transmission so that the intended recipients can read or hear them (Figure 10.23). Scrambling messages before you send using a key-the code that scrambles and then decodes messages-prevents eavesdroppers who might intercept them from deciphering them without the decoding key. (The science of encryption is called cryptography .) Encryption can be used to protect data that are transmitted over the internet (e.g., your new purchase at Amazon), calls on your mobile phone, or files or folders containing sensitive data or for various other scenarios requiring confidentiality of data. Some chatting and instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and

INFORMATION SYSTEMS TODAY

Telegram use end-to-end encryption , making it impossible for eavesdroppers (criminals as well as governmental organizations) to gain access to the communication. Such end-to-end encrypted communication is controversial because it is alleged that many terrorist groups and criminals utilize end-to-end encryption to obscure their communications; in contrast, it can facilitate communication in countries where freedom of speech is not guaranteed and dissidents face persecution from the government.

There are many different encryption approaches for different types of data transmission. Traditional encryption methods require the sending and receiving party to have the same key to encode and decode the message (these methods are referred to as symmetric encryption ); however, such methods require a secure channel to share the encryption key between the two parties before messages can be securely transmitted. Public key encryption , in contrast, is a form of asymmetric encryption that uses a pair of keys-a public and a private key. Using public key encryption (such as PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy), a message can be encoded using the recipient's public key, and the recipient can then use his or her private key to decode the message. As anyone can access the public key, anyone can encrypt a message; however, as only the recipient has access to the private key, no one else is able to decrypt the message. Implementing such encryption on a large scale, such as on a busy website, requires a third party, called a certificate authority , to help manage the distribution of keys. The certificate authority acts as a trusted middleman between computers and verifies that a website is a trusted site. The certificate authority knows that each computer is who it says it is and provides the encryption/decryption keys to each computer. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) , developed by Netscape, is a popular public key encryption method used on the internet.

Cloud Security With more and more data and applications being moved to the cloud, cloud security is becoming increasingly important; specifically, organizations not only need to secure data at rest (e.g., files or folders stored on a physical medium) and data in transit (i.e., data traveling across a network) but also data in use (i.e., data being processed by a computer) (Figure 10.24). Regular encryption approaches can be utilized to secure data at rest and data in transit; securing data in use is more problematic, as encrypted data typically need to be decrypted before being processed, even for simple manipulations such as summing up a range of numbers. However, during processing, the cloud service provider would be able to access the decrypted

## COMING ATTRACTIONS

## Can We Eliminate Passwords?

Have you ever had a tough time remembering one of your passwords? If you are like most of us, this has happened more than once. Luckily, many new smartphones, laptops, and computer keyboards sport biometric scanners, enabling users to log in without having to remember the password. Likewise, other advanced security devices scan a person's face or retina to grant access to systems or facilities. yet, as you probably have seen in the movies, such security measures can be defeated. for example, you may have seen someone taking the fingerprints a person left on a drinking glass to produce a fake fingerprint; given that the surface of your phone is likely covered with fingerprints, the scanner could be easily foiled. In more gruesome movie scenes, you may have seen the villain mutilate someone's thumb to obtain access to a secure facility. In addition, once criminals have gained access to a person's fingerprint or retina data, the data will remain compromised forever, as, unlike a password, a person's fingerprint or retina cannot be changed.

case, one could use a traditional, yet vulnerable to faking, biometric as discussed above (e.g., fingerprint, retina, iris), combined with another biometric that is not easily faked. A keyboard is a standard input device, yet we all use the keyboard differently, press the keys at a different pace, and with a different rhythm. Typing biometrics are driven by our brain, and therefore cannot be easily reproduced like a fingerprint, facial model, or even retina scan. TypingDNA is one such company that offers a typing biometric system that combines the security strength of multiple biometrics, with ease of use and implementation because it relies on standard computer hardware. While it might be some time before we use typing biometrics to unlock our systems, it could be a valuable method for authenticating a person's identity in many security conscious systems of the future.

## Based on:

There are, however, a few different emerging authentication mechanisms for eliminating passwords completely, and some do not require significant investment in new infrastructure or technology. for example, the European Banking Authority has recently approved typing biometrics as one component of a multi-factor authentication system.

Recently, researchers have developed new algorithms that allow for 'encryption in use,' such that the encrypted data can be processed without being accessible to a cloud service provider.

VIRUS MONITORING AND PREVENTION. Virus prevention , which is a set of activities for detecting and preventing computer viruses, has become a full-time, important task for IS departments within organizations and for all of us with our personal computers. While viruses often have colorful names-Melissa, I Love You, Naked Wife-they can be catastrophic from a computing perspective. Here we describe some precautions you can take to ensure that your computer is protected:

- ■ Install antivirus software, then update frequently to be sure you are protected against new viruses.
- ■ Do not use flash drives or shareware from unknown or suspect sources and be equally careful when downloading material from the internet, making sure that the source is reputable.
- ■ Delete without opening any email message received from an unknown source. Be especially wary of opening attachments. It is better to delete a legitimate message than to infect your computer system with a destructive virus.
- ■ Do not blindly open email attachments, even if they come from a known source (such as a friend or coworker). Many viruses are spread without the sender's knowledge, so it is better to check with the sender before opening a potentially unsafe attachment.
- ■ If your computer system contracts a virus, report the infection to your school or company's IS department so that appropriate measures can be taken.

SECURE DATA CENTERS. Specialized facilities are an important component of creating a reliable and secure IS infrastructure. Data and the ability to process the data are the lifeblood for many of today's large organizations, such as Amazon, Travelocity, or Facebook. Consequently, organizations need to protect important equipment from outside intruders and from the elements,

<!-- image -->

such as water or fire. The most prominent threats to an organization's IS facilities come from floods, seismic activity, rolling blackouts, hurricanes, and the potential of criminal activities (Figure 10.25). How can an organization reliably protect its facilities from such threats?

Ensuring Business Continuity As many potential causes of disasters cannot be avoided (there's no way to stop a hurricane), organizations should attempt to plan for the worst and implement necessary controls in their data centers. For companies operating in the digital world, the IS infrastructure is critical for most business processes, so special care must be taken to secure it. Whereas some applications can tolerate some downtime in case something malfunctions or disaster strikes, other applications (such as UPS's package routing systems) can't tolerate any downtime-these companies need 24/7/365 reliability (Figure 10.26).

Securing the Facilities Infrastructure An organization's data centers always need to be secured and protected from outside intruders. Absolute protection against security breaches remains out of reach, but here are a few safeguards organizations can employ:

- ■ Site Selection. Organizations should ensure that data centers are not built in areas that are prone to earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or other damaging natural forces.
- ■ Physical Access Restrictions. As with any valuable asset, data centers should be protected from intruders using measures such as fences, barriers, and security guards. Organizations should also strive to maintain information about data center locations confidential.
- ■ Intrusion Detection. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems should monitor the physical interior and/or exterior of a facility for physical intruders, allowing in-house security personnel or an outside security service to detect and immediately report suspicious activity. In addition, security alarm systems using motion, sound, and/or vibration detectors should be installed. Recording CCTV footage as well as all events from the security alarm systems can help investigate the causes of an intrusion.
- ■ Uninterruptible Power and Cooling. To ensure uninterrupted service, data centers should be self-sufficient and be able to operate for a pre-specified time period on self-generated power. In addition to implementing an uninterruptible power supply for powering the

computers, the data center should provide for continuous cooling in case of a power interruption (some data centers store chilled water for such purposes).

- ■ Protection from Environmental Threats. To protect the data centers from the elements, data centers should be built to withstand strong winds (depending on the location). Other measures include raised floors (to protect from floods) as well as heat sensors, smoke detectors, and fire suppression systems.

For reasons of business continuity, companies such as UPS maintain large data centers in different geographic areas. Many (especially smaller) organizations do not need facilities the size of one of the UPS data centers; instead, they may just need space for a few servers. For such needs, companies can turn to collocation facilities . Organizations can rent space (usually in the form of cabinets or shares of a cabinet) for their servers in such collocation facilities, and the organizations managing collocation facilities provide the necessary infrastructure in terms of power, backups, connectivity, and security. Alternatively, organizations increasingly attempt to transfer risk by using cloud computing services.

MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT. With mobile devices being used by large numbers of organizational users, protecting mobile devices and the data stored thereon is of crucial importance. Mobile device management (MDM) is the administration of an organization's mobile devices to enforce authorization policies, prevent the downloading or installing of nonapproved apps, or remotely lock the devices or wipe data. Often, third-party software is used for MDM; such software solutions can also be used to prevent jailbreaking, perform security scans, or preconfigure approved Wi-Fi hotspots or VPN services.

SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS. As outlined in Chapter 9, 'Developing and Acquiring Information Systems,' system development and acquisition processes must also be carefully controlled and managed. When systems are designed or purchased, care must be taken that all security features are implemented, enabled, and managed and that any changes are properly managed and documented to prevent risks from software bugs or hidden backdoors.

HUMAN CONTROLS. In addition to the technological controls, various human safeguards can help to protect information systems, specifically ethics, laws, and effective management (Figure 10.27). IS ethics , discussed in Chapter 1, relates to a broad range of standards of appropriate conduct by users. Educating potential users as to what constitutes appropriate behavior can help, but unethical users will undoubtedly always remain a problem for those

wanting to maintain IS security. Additionally, there are numerous federal and state laws against unauthorized use of networks and computer systems. Unfortunately, individuals who want to access networks and computer systems usually find a way to access them; often, after the fact, laws are enacted to prohibit that activity in the future. Finally, effective management that defines appropriate oversight and control over what information and activities employees can and cannot perform is critical for having strong and robust information systems security.

DEPLOYMENT AND TRAINING. Once the organization has decided on the necessary controls, network security mechanisms such as firewalls are deployed, as are intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, manual and automated log examination software, and host- and networkbased intrusion detection software (discussed below). Passwords, smart cards, and smart badges are also disseminated and explained during this phase. The IS department is usually responsible for implementing these controls. At the same time, personnel throughout the organization should receive training about the security policies and plans for disaster recovery and be prepared to perform assigned tasks in that regard-both routinely on a daily basis and disaster related.

## Monitoring Security

To minimize risk, organizations should continuously monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Any user-authorized or unauthorized-leaves electronic footprints that can be traced. Automated log examination software and host- and network-based intrusion detection software is used to keep track of computer activity to spot suspicious activity and take action. Using such software helps create an audit trail, which is a record showing who has accessed a computer system and how it was used. For the software to effectively protect security, of course, auditors within the organization-most often someone in the IS department or information security department-must monitor and interpret the results. Needless to say, the level of monitoring should be based on an assessment of the potential impact of a certain asset being compromised; in other words, the most monitoring efforts should be focused on high-risk systems. In addition to monitoring internal events, organizations should also monitor external events to obtain a full view of threats and vulnerabilities (Figure 10.28).

MONITORING EXTERNAL EVENTS. Several online organizations issue bulletins to alert organizations and individuals to possible software vulnerabilities or attacks based on reports from organizations that have experienced security breaches. Further, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC, https://www.nationalisacs.org) representing various industry sectors and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (https://www.us-cert.gov) provide additional resources for organizations by publishing security alerts or conducting and publishing research related to IS security.

IS AUDITING. Monitoring internal and external vulnerability information should be an ongoing process for organizations. However, it can also be beneficial for organizations to periodically have an external entity review the controls to uncover any potential problems. An information systems audit , often performed by external auditors, can help organizations assess the state of their IS controls to determine necessary changes and to help ensure the information systems' availability,

## FIGURE 10.28

integrity, and confidentiality. The response to the strengths and weaknesses identified in the IS audit is often determined by the potential risks an organization faces. In other words, the IS audit must assess whether the IS controls in place are sufficient to address the potential risks. Thus, a major component of the IS audit is a risk assessment (discussed in prior sections), which aims to determine what type of risks the organization's IS infrastructure faces, the criticality of those risks to the infrastructure, and the level of risks the organization is willing to tolerate.

Once the risk has been assessed, auditors evaluate the organization's internal controls, trying to answer questions such as: Can the intrusion detection system detect attacks? Are incident response procedures effective? Can the network be penetrated? Is physical security adequate? Do employees know security policies and procedures? In other words, auditors assess aspects such as policy adherence, the security of new projects, and whether the organization's defense layers can be penetrated. During such audits, the auditor tries to gather evidence regarding the effectiveness of the controls. However, testing all controls under all possible conditions is very inefficient and often infeasible. Thus, auditors frequently rely on computer-assisted audit tools to test applications and data using test data or simulations, or tools such as vulnerability scanners or packet sniffers. In addition to using specific auditing tools, auditors use audit sampling procedures to assess the controls, enabling the audit to be conducted in the most cost-effective manner. Further, penetration tests are conducted in-house and/or by an outside contractor to see how well the organization's computer security measures are working. Once the audit has been completed and sufficient evidence has been gathered, reports are issued to the organization. Usually, such reports are followed up with a discussion of the results and potential courses of action.

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. Performing an IS audit can help an organization reduce costs or remain competitive by identifying areas where IS controls are lacking and need improvement. Another major factor that has contributed to a high demand for IS auditors is the need to comply with government regulations, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (hereafter S-OX). Formed as a reaction to large-scale accounting scandals that led to the downfall of corporations such as WorldCom and Enron and to protect investors from fraudulent practices by organizations, S-OX mandates companies to demonstrate compliance with accounting standards and to establish controls and sound corporate governance. Commonly used controls include limiting a single employee's influence over transactions, such as by segregation of duties and establishing proper checks and balances. For example, if the employee who creates a purchase order also has the authority to approve the purchase order, this opens up a possibility for creating fraudulent orders; similarly, if the same employee is responsible for disbursing cash, recording the disbursements, and reconciling the related accounts, the employee can devise schemes to embezzle money. Implementing proper controls not only helps reduce the potential for fraud but also helps prevent unintentional errors. To demonstrate S-OX compliance, public companies are required, among other things, to have external auditors assess the effectiveness of their internal controls as well as audit their financial statements. While S-OX addresses primarily the accounting side of organizations, it is of major importance to include IS controls in compliance reviews, given the importance of an IS infrastructure and IS controls for an organization's financial applications.

According to S-OX, companies must demonstrate that there are controls in place to prevent misuse or fraud, controls to detect any potential problems, and effective measures to correct any problems; S-OX goes so far that corporate executives face jail time and heavy fines if the appropriate controls are not in place or are ineffective. The IS architecture plays a key role in S-OX compliance, given that many controls are IS based, providing capabilities to detect exceptions and providing an audit trail for tracing these. However, S-OX itself barely addresses IS controls

specifically; rather, it addresses general processes and practices, leaving companies wondering how to comply with the guidelines put forth in the act. Further, it is often cumbersome and timeconsuming for organizations to identify the relevant systems to be audited for S-OX compliance. Thus, many organizations find it easier to review their entire IS infrastructure, following objectives set forth in guidelines such as the control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) -a set of best practices that helps organizations both maximize the benefits from their IS infrastructure and establish appropriate controls.

Another issue faced by organizations because of S-OX is the requirement to preserve evidence to document compliance and for potential lawsuits. Since the inception of S-OX, emails and even instant messages have achieved the same status as regular business documents and thus need to be preserved for a period-typically up to seven years. Failure to present such documents in the case of litigious activity can lead to severe fines being imposed on companies and their executives, and courts usually will not accept the argument that a message could not be located. For example, the investment bank Morgan Stanley faced fines up to US$15 million for failing to retain email messages. On the surface, it seems easiest for an organization to simply archive all the email messages sent and received. However, such a 'digital landfill,' where everything is stored, can quickly grow to an unmanageable size, and companies cannot comply with the mandate to present evidence in a timely manner. Thus, many organizations turn to email management software that archives and categorizes all incoming and outgoing emails based on key words. Even using such specialized software, finding emails related to a certain topic within the archive can pose a tremendous task; some analysts estimate that a business with 25,000 employees generates more than 4 billion email messages over the course of seven years (not counting any increase in email activity), which would be hard to handle for even the most sophisticated programs.

RESPONDING TO SECURITY INCIDENTS. Organizations that have developed a comprehensive IS security plan will have the ability to rapidly respond to any type of security breach to their IS resources or to a natural disaster. Typically, incident handling policies detail how the incident is classified in terms of severity, who has the authority to escalate the incident, and what incidents need to be internally or externally reported. Responses to a security breach include containing the security breach, restoring systems, and notifying or assisting customers (if needed). Further, when intruders are discovered, organizations can contact local law enforcement agencies and the FBI for assistance in locating and prosecuting the intruders. In addition, common responses to a security breach include performing a new risk audit and implementing a combination of additional (more secure) controls (as described previously).

COMPUTER FORENSICS. As computer crime has gone mainstream, law enforcement has had to become much more sophisticated in their computer crime investigations. Computer forensics is the use of formal investigative techniques to evaluate digital information for judicial review. Most often, computer forensics experts evaluate various types of storage devices to find traces of illegal activity or to gain evidence in related non-computer crimes. In fact, in most missing-person or murder cases today, investigators immediately want to examine the victim's computer for clues or evidence.

Organizations and governments are increasingly utilizing honeypots to proactively gather intelligence to improve their defenses or to catch cybercriminals. A honeypot is a computer, data, or network site that is designed to be enticing to crackers to detect, deflect, or counteract illegal activity. Many law enforcement agencies operate honeypots in the dark web to gather intelligence and find criminals (Murdock, 2016). The dark web refers to web content that is used for various nefarious purposes. Content on the dark web is not indexed by popular search engines like Google and Bing and is typically only accessible using specialized browsers that anonymize the user and hide traces (the underlying infrastructure, which directs internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of relays and virtual tunnels-rather than the usual direct connections to internet sites-is often referred to as dark net). Illegal content on the dark web includes everything from child pornography to black markets and hacker forums for sharing tools and information.

Although computer forensics experts are extremely skilled in investigating prior and ongoing computer crime, many computer criminals are also experts, making the forensics process extremely difficult in some cases. Some criminals, for example, have special 'booby-trap' programs running on computers to destroy evidence if someone other than the criminal uses the machine. Using special software tools, computer forensics experts can often restore data that have been deleted from a computer's hard drive. Additionally, given the proliferation of computer crime, there is a growing backlog of cases where computer forensics experts are needed. Backlogs in analyzing computers, smartphones, online activities, and communications are leading to

long delays in the criminal justice system, resulting in some cases being dropped and others being inadequately investigated. Further, growing sizes of people's hard drives, or, in the case of companies, databases containing tens or hundreds of terabytes of Big Data, cause additional challenges for forensic experts. Clearly, computer forensics will continue to evolve as criminals utilize more sophisticated computer-based methods for committing and aiding criminal activities.

As you can see, securing information systems consists of various activities, with protection against computer crime being the most visible-but not the only-aspect. Given the ubiquity and increasing complexity of information systems, securing information systems will remain a hot topic for organizations and individuals alike, and we need to continue to implement vigilant approaches to better manage information systems security in the digital world.

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

## Cybercops Track Cybercriminals

The CSI ( Crime Scene Investigation ) television shows have made 'DNA testing' a household phrase. Virtually everyone knows that a criminal who leaves body cells or fluids-hair and skin cells, saliva, blood, semen, and so on-at the scene of a crime can be linked to the crime through DNA analysis. (DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is present in all living tissue-plant or animal.) Just as a criminal leaves DNA traces, cybercriminals are leaving digital footprints. However, using computer forensics to track down cybercriminals requires sophisticated tools and methods.

across the country and around the world, allowing law enforcement to also benefit from the internet age.

Because technological advancement has been rapid, law enforcement has lagged behind cybercriminals but is catching up. In the united States, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section within the Department of Justice is devoted to combating computer crime. In addition, the fBI has created cyber-squads in 56 field offices around the country specifically to investigate computer crime in addition to a cyber-division at the fBI headquarters. Each federal judicial district has at least one assistant u.S. attorney who has received special training in how to investigate and prosecute computer crime. Every state now has a computer crime investigation unit available as a resource to local law enforcement agencies, and many municipal police departments have their own computer crime investigative units.

Software tools available to law enforcement agencies have improved greatly in recent years. Programs to conduct forensic analyses of computer drives or smartphones have become standard practice, even those systems that are encrypted. Photo databases of known criminals, including any distinctive features such as scars and tattoos, go way beyond the fingerprint identification of yesteryear. Similarly, advanced tools using data mining and machine learning are helping detectives find patterns that can connect related crimes.

In addition to these advances, 3D technology is now widely used for re-creating crime scenes, from comparing footprints to testing crime theories. for example, modern 3D forensic ballistics technologies help to re-create a crime scene for understanding the shooter's location and the path of bullets. These technologies are also capable of creating a 3D image of a bullet that has been fired and then finding a match from previous criminal cases. Data can be shared

While these advances have greatly helped law enforcement solve a broad range of crimes, the prevalence of sophisticated tools on entertainment programs like CSI has created the so-called 'CSI effect.' The CSI effect refers to the tendency of jurors to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials due to advances in forensic and investigative technology that are learned by watching modern police shows, thereby raising the effective standard of proof for prosecutors. It is unfortunate that criminals use the internet and other technologies to their advantage. Clearly, however, law enforcement is keeping pace with them; officers use technological advances to track, arrest, and prosecute online and offline criminals.

## Key Points Review

1. Define computer crime and describe several types of computer crime. Computer crime is defined as the use of a computer to commit an illegal act, such as targeting a computer while committing an offense, using a computer to commit an offense, or using computers in the course of a criminal activity. Those who break into computer systems with the intention of doing damage or committing a crime are usually called crackers. Crackers are associated with creating and distributing computer viruses and other destructive code. People are increasingly using information systems to aid in crimes against individuals, including identity theft, cyberharassment, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying. Finally, making illegal copies of software, a worldwide computer crime, is called software piracy.
2. Describe and explain differences between cyberwar and cyberterrorism. Cyberwar refers to an organized attempt by a country's military to disrupt or destroy the information and communication systems of another country. The goal of cyberwar is to turn the balance of information and knowledge in one's favor to diminish an opponent's capabilities while enhancing those of the attacker. Cyberterrorism is the use of computer and networking technologies by individuals and organized groups against persons or property to intimidate or coerce governments, civilians, or any segment of society to attain political, religious, or ideological goals. Now that terrorist
3. groups are increasingly using the internet for their purposes, one of the great fears about cyberterrorism is that an attack can be launched from a computer anywhere in the world.
3. Discuss the process of managing IS security and describe various IS controls that can help in ensuring IS security. Information systems security refers to precautions taken to keep all aspects of information systems (e.g., all hardware, software, network equipment, and data) safe from unauthorized use or access, to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. IS security is an ongoing process, consisting of assessing risks, developing a security strategy, implementing controls and training, and monitoring security. An information systems risk assessment is performed to identify threats and vulnerabilities, determine their probabilities of being exploited, and assess the potential impact. An IS security strategy details what controls should be implemented as well as securityrelated policies and procedures. General categories of controls include: physical access restrictions, firewalls, encryption, virus monitoring and protection, secure data centers, systems development controls, and human controls. To ensure the effectiveness of the controls, organizations should continuously monitor internal and external events and periodically perform IS audits.

## Cryptocurrency Fraud

In recent years, there have been a proliferation of cryptocurrencies, a decentralized digital currency which serves as a medium of exchange. Popular examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. Due to the decentralized (not controlled by Central Banks) and open (freely available)  nature  of  the  underlying  blockchain  technology of cryptocurrencies, anyone can create their own versions, leading to their proliferation. In addition, the value of cryptocurrency  is  not  stable  but  volatile,  which  can  fluctuate quickly,  making  it  an  attractive  investment  opportunity. Giving the growing popularity and astronomical valuation of some cryptocurrencies, there is a lot of interest.

Cybercriminals are capitalizing on this growing interest and investment in cryptocurrencies to defraud many people. There have been incidents of fraudsters hacking the Twitter accounts of prominent people including Narendra

## Database Application: Tracking Software Licenses at Campus Travel

Recently, you have taken on the position of IS manager at Campus Travel. In your second week at work, you realize that many of the software licenses are about to expire or have already expired. As you know about the legal and ethical implications of unlicensed software, you have decided to set up a software asset management system that lets you keep track of the software licenses. You have already set up a database and stored some of the information, but you want to make the system more user friendly. Using the SWLicenses.mdb database, design a form to input the following information for new software products:

- ■ Software title
- ■ Installation location (office)
- ■ License number
- ■ Expiration date

Furthermore, design a report displaying all software licenses and expiration dates (sorted by expiration dates). (Hint: In Microsoft Access, use the form and report wizards to create the forms and reports; you will find the wizards under the 'Create' tab.)

## CASE 1 SingPass: E-Government Security

Singapore Personal Access (SingPass) is Singapore's online account management system  that  gives  residents  access  to e-government services. Implemented in March 2003, SingPass provides access to hundreds of e-services across more than 60 government agencies. In 2020, SingPass had over 4 million users.

SingPass was developed and managed by multiple agencies to improve and finetune its security policies. SingPass was init i a l l y   managed  by  the  Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) and then transferred to the newly formed Government Technology Agency (GovTech).

activate, and link their 2FA. However, based on user feedback, the sign-up process was soon simplified to a single step that can be done directly at the SingPass site. To further ensure greater compliance, all SingPass users are now automatically enrolled for 2FA, which must be activated by users using a PIN. Activation that earlier could only be done through the official website of Assurity (an IDA subsidiary that supplied the 2FA solution) has been simplified by using SMS activation. Identity verification can now also take place through fingerprint and face recognition.

SingPass's  account  management includes a number of features to ensure safety. First, SingPass accounts that have been unused for more than three years are automatically reset. Second, users are asked to change and enhance the strength of their password every two years. Third, users are required to enter a randomized security code when they fail to log in three times consecutively. Lastly, users are notified via a letter sent to their registered address whenever they change their personal information.

In July 2015, the IDA put in place a stronger security measure in the form of 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), a standard feature of online banking for e-government transactions involving sensitive data. It involves the use of one-time passwords sent via SMS to the user's registered mobile phone. When first implemented, users had to visit three different websites to register, code. A reduced number of touchpoints reduces the risk of fraud. (Compare it to opening one door instead of many: the chances of something going wrong are less). According to the manager, a SafeEntry check-in makes sure that users can scan a QR code or search for their location via the app without having to physically record their details.

No system is perfect. Thus, despite the security breaches described here, SingPass is regarded a relatively safe system. As a result, many institutions  and  companies  have switched to SingPass as a login mechanism. This has two advantages. Firstly, it is more convenient for the customers. Secondly, it decreases the risk of hacks. In September 2021, internet service provider ViewQwest decided to switch to a log-in system based in SingPass to increase security and convenience for its customers. Singapore's Inland Revenue Authority also uses SingPass. It is also possible now to use the pass for banking on the internet. There are even plans to allow Singaporeans to use digital identity cards (based on SingPass) when using government services in person (as opposed to digitally).

Despite  these  measures,  SingPass accounts have not been spared from cyberattacks. In 2011, 293 SingPass accounts were hacked because of weak passwords-they were the same as the account name! In June 2014, about 1,600 accounts were compromised, which the IDA came to know about only after 11 users reported getting suspicious password-reset letters even though they didn't change their passwords. The IDA acted quickly and urged users to use strong passwords, update their software, and install anti-virus software. Existing measures were re-enforced, such as the use of captcha and sending letters to users' residential addresses when SingPass passwords were changed.

In 2018, the SingPass app was introduced, which increased both security and convenience. According to Tay Li Soon, senior product manager at GovTech, the app helped reduce the number of touchpoints and users only needed to scan a QR

One of the lasting successes of SingPass has been that it has convinced the citizens of Singapore as well as companies and institutions that it is convenient and safe. This was undoubtedly helped by the powerful data security legislations in Singapore: hacks and other security breaches have to be reported immediately. As of 2022, the future of SingPass looks bright.

## CASE 2 China's Great (Fire) Wall

Welcome to modern-day China, where the government blocks website access to the country's 900 million internet users on such subjects as democracy, Tibet, Taiwan, health, education, news, entertainment, religion, and revolution. Various chat rooms, blogs, photo- and video-sharing sites, gaming and podcasting sites, and bulletin boards are also forbidden stops on the web, and don't  even  think  about  searching  for 'Tiananmen Square massacre' or anything remotely considered pornographic.

even posts containing rumors about a price increase of the Beijing subway were blocked.

Building censorship into China's internet infrastructure is the first step for the country's government in controlling access to politically sensitive material. To accomplish this, the Chinese government prevents internet service providers (ISPs)-many of them privately held businesses, some with foreign investments-from hosting any material the government calls politically objectionable by holding the ISPs liable for content and imposing severe penalties for violations, including imprisonment.

In addition, the Chinese government targets  internet  content  providers  (ICPsorganizations and individuals who have a web presence in China, both nonprofit and for profit), who are required to register for and post a license to operate legally, and like ISPs, are held liable for politically incorrect content. To keep a license, ICPs must police sites for objectionable content and must take down those sites that violate regulations governing content. Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, Apple, LinkedIn, and others act or have acted as ICPs in China and have been criticized for complying with China's strict internet censorship policy. Likewise, posts on various chat rooms or Weibo-China's equivalent to Twitterare removed if they contain terms deemed to be 'disturbing social order,' 'undermining social stability,' or 'spreading rumors,' among other offenses. Certain terms are often blocked after notable events. For example, the term 'Kunming Train Station' was blocked after a knife attack at the station; at times,

## Questions

Should foreign companies provide their technologies to China knowing that the technologies are used to limit the individual freedom of Chinese citizens? Why or why not?

10-55.

Given that China has the largest number of internet users, do you think it can ultimately succeed in controlling information? Why or why not?

Should the rest of the world care if China limits information access within China? Why or why not? Now that Google

Managing ISPs and ICPs is not the only tool China has for controlling what content its citizens can access. Beginning operations in 2003, China instituted the Golden Shield Project. More popularly known as 'The Great Firewall of China,' the system can automatically filter and block content that the government deems inappropriate. Through IP tracking, blocking, DNS/URL filtering, and redirection, the Golden Shield not only blocks and filters content but acts as a surveillance system as well. The Great Firewall also creates a sluggish and congested network infrastructure, though some believe this is intentional to discourage internet use.

In mid-2020, more than 13,500 domains were blocked in China, not only including Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, and YouTube, but also domains belonging to Home Depot, Pottery Barn, and most U.S. government agencies. This heavy censorship made China's internet (sometimes referred to as 'China's Intranet') one of the most heavily censored in the world, similar to countries such as Belarus, Iran, or North Korea.

Historically, many foreign ICPs have cooperated with the Chinese government by censoring information in order to operate in the country. Yahoo! and Hotmail are the only non-Chinese companies providing email service in China, and Yahoo! has even turned over e-mail content to the authorities, resulting in the prosecution and conviction of at least four persons for criticizing the government. In 2010, however, Google took a different course with China.

In late 2009, Google was hit with a sophisticated attack on its Gmail servers and some of its other corporate networks. Google believed that the attack was an attempt to access the Gmail accounts of human rights  activists.  Up  until  then, Google had been censoring content like other ICPs, tailoring results to remove topics deemed subversive or pornographic. However, after the network attack, tensions began to rise between Google and China, as it was widely believed that the attacks came from the Chinese government or were at least sponsored by it in an effort to root out political dissidents. As a result, Google threatened to end its practice of censoring search results or even completely pull its business out of China.

Early in 2010, Google made the decision to redirect all its search traffic in China to servers in Hong Kong (where greater civil liberties remained until July 2020), effectively ending its practice of censoring results and opening unrestricted searches to the Chinese public. Within days of the move, China began filtering and blocking searches directed to the Hong Kong servers using the Golden Shield system and even pulled out of lucrative agreements to use Google's Android operating system on a number of mobile platforms. In March 2010, Google's annual license to be an ICP in China expired. In summer 2010, China renewed Google's license, but as of July 2020 most of Google's services are blocked in mainland China.

As is true of most attempts to censor the internet, tech-savvy users in China find ways to circumvent the government's firewall. One group of Chinese dissidents created Greatfire.org, which includes mirror duplicates of several blocked websites. The group also created Freeweibo.com, which collects and publishes posts deleted from China's popular social media service Sina Weibo. Another example is an iPhone app called FireChat, a mobile messaging app designed to allow anonymous group messaging through the iPhone's peer-to-peer and Bluetooth connections. The app was recently used as a part of a political protest in Taiwan, and protesters in Taiwan and China  were  able  to  communicate  and encourage each other without censorship from the Chinese government.

has moved against censorship, do you think other companies will follow suit? Why or why not?
